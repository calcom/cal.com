## How Domain-Wide Delegation works
- cal.com instance admin needs to create a workspace platform which requires Service Account Key.
- After this, organization owner can create a domain-wide-delegation for that workspace platform and a domain of their choice.
- No Credential table entry is created at the moment but the workspace platform's related apps will be considered as "installed" for the users with email matchind dwd domain. An in-memory credential like object is created for this purpose. It allows avoiding creation of thousands of records for all the members of the organization when dwd is enabled.
