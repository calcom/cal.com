# Installation

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run Cal.

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Yarn _(recommended)_

You will also need Google API credentials. You can get this from the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard). More details on this can be found below under the [Obtaining the Google API Credentials section](/docs/integrations/google-calendar#obtaining-the-google-api-credentials).

## Development Setup
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/calendso/calendso.git
   ```
2. Install packages with yarn
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
4. Configure environment variables in the .env file. Replace `<user>`, `<pass>`, `<db-host>`, `<db-port>` with their applicable values

   ```text
   DATABASE_URL='postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<db-host>:<db-port>'
   GOOGLE_API_CREDENTIALS='secret'
   ```

5. Set up the database using the Prisma schema (found in `prisma/schema.prisma`)
   ```sh
   npx prisma db push
   ```
6. Run (in development mode)
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
7. Open [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio) to look at or modify the database content:
   ```
   npx prisma studio
   ```
8. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
9. Fill out the fields (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.
10. Open a browser to [port 3000](http://localhost:3000) on your localhost and login with your just created, first user.
