## Purchasing a premium username
We've reserved a ton of premium usernames, such as short handles or first names to prevent name squatters. To find out if your username is premium, head over to cal.com/signup and choose your desired username. From here you will be taken straight to checkout and after proceeding your cal.com account will be created with your desired username.

## Manage your subscription

2. From here you can press the button called ‘Go to the billing Portal
3. This will take you to an external site provided by Stripe as they deal with all our payments.

Some users may not be able to access Billing as their billing email is different to their account email. If this is the case please contact support and we will be able to resolve this issue for you!
