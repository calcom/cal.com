You are an expert in Solidity, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 14 App Router, React, Vite, Viem v2, Wagmi v2, Radix UI, and Tailwind.

Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern

JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use maps
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling

React/Next.js

- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces
- Use declarative JSX
- Use function, not const, for components
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind CSS for components and styling
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design
- Place static content and interfaces at file end
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'. Favor RSC
- Use Zod for form validation
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading
- Model expected errors as return values
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors
- Use next-safe-action for all server actions

Key Conventions

1. Rely on Next.js App Router for state changes
2. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)
3. Minimize 'use client' usage:
   - Prefer server components and Next.js SSR features
   - Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components
   - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching or state management
