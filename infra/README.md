## Infrastructure Folder
This folder, located within the "infra" directory of our monorepo, is dedicated to managing the infrastructure as code (IaC) and Docker-related files for our project. It plays a critical role in orchestrating, configuring, and maintaining the infrastructure that our applications rely on.
