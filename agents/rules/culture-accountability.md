## Hold Each Other Accountable for Quality

**Impact: MEDIUM**

We hold each other accountable for quality. Cutting corners might feel faster in the moment, but it creates problems that slow everyone down later. When you see a teammate about to merge a PR with obvious issues, speak up.

**This isn't about being difficult or slowing people down.** It's about collective ownership of our codebase and our reputation. Every shortcut one person takes becomes everyone's problem. Every corner cut today means more debugging sessions, more hotfixes, and more frustrated customers tomorrow.

**Make it normal to challenge poor decisions, respectfully:**

```
// When someone says:
"Let's just hard-code this for now"

// The expected response:
"What would it take to do it the proper way the first time?"
```

```
// When someone wants to commit untested code:
"Can we add tests for this before merging? I can help if needed."
```

```
// When someone suggests copy-paste instead of abstraction:
"This looks like it could be a shared utility. Should we extract it?"
```

**We're building something that needs to almost never fail.** That level of reliability doesn't happen by accident. It happens when every engineer feels responsible for quality - not just their own code but the entire system. We succeed as a team or we fail as a team.

**Key behaviors:**
- Push back when you see shortcuts being taken
- Offer to help when suggesting improvements
- Accept feedback gracefully when others challenge your decisions
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Remember that quality standards protect everyone
