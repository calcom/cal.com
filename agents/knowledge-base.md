# Knowledge Base - Domain & Product-Specific Information

This file contains domain knowledge about the Cal.com product and codebase. For coding guidelines and rules, see [`rules/`](rules/).

## When working with managed event types

When a managed event type is created, we create:
- A **parent managed event type** for the team (has `teamId` set in EventType table)
- A **child managed event type** for each assigned user (has `userId` set in EventType table)

Example: If we create a managed event type and assign Alice and Bob, three rows will be inserted in the EventType table (1 parent + 2 children).

**Important**: Only child managed event types can be booked.

## When working with organizations and teams

Both organizations and teams are stored in the `Team` table:
- **Organizations**: Have `isOrganization` set to `true`
- **Teams within an organization**: Have `parentId` set (pointing to the organization)

## When working with OAuth clients

There are two types of OAuth clients:

| Type | Table | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| OAuth client | `OAuthClient` | Allows 3rd party apps to connect users' cal.com accounts |
| Platform OAuth client | `PlatformOAuthClient` | Used by platform customers integrating cal.com scheduling directly in their platforms |

If someone says "platform OAuth client" they mean the one in the `PlatformOAuthClient` table.

## When you need product or codebase context

### Monorepo Structure

The whole repository is a monorepo. The main web app is in `apps/web` folder.

### Local Development Database

When setting up local development database, it creates test users. The passwords are the same as the username:
- `free:free`
- `pro:pro`

### Logging Levels

Control logging verbosity by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL` in .env:
- 0: silly
- 1: trace
- 2: debug
- 3: info
- 4: warn
- 5: error
- 6: fatal

### Cal.com Event Identification

Cal.com events in Google Calendar can be identified by checking if the iCalUID ends with `@Cal.com` (e.g., `2GBXSdEixretciJfKVmYN8@Cal.com`). This identifier is used to distinguish Cal.com bookings from other calendar events for data storage and privacy purposes.

### UI Component Locations

- Event types page: `apps/web/modules/event-types/views/event-types-listing-view.tsx`
- Bookings page: `apps/web/modules/bookings/views/bookings-view.tsx`
- Shared elements (tabs, search bars, filter buttons) should maintain consistent alignment across views

### DataTable

Refer to the DataTable guide at `packages/features/data-table/GUIDE.md` for implementation patterns and best practices.

### Round-Robin Scheduling

Reuse existing code in `packages/features/bookings/lib/getLuckyUser.ts` which handles:
- Weight-based selection
- Priority ranking
- Round-robin fairness algorithms

Check if existing functions can be extended before creating new implementations.

### Calendar Cache System

The calendar cache system follows specific patterns in `packages/features/calendar-cache-sql`. When implementing provider-specific calendar cache services (like for Outlook/Office365), place the provider-specific code in the corresponding provider directory (e.g., `packages/app-store/office365calendar`).

### API Documentation

The OpenAPI specification at `docs/api-reference/v2/openapi.json` is auto-generated from NestJS controllers. Manual edits will be wiped out.

To make persistent changes to API documentation, use NestJS decorators (`@ApiQuery`, `@ApiOperation`, etc.) in the controller files at `apps/api/v2/src/modules/*/controllers/*.controller.ts`.

### Workflows vs Webhooks

Workflows and webhooks are two completely separate features in Cal.com with different implementations and file structures:
- Workflow constants: `packages/features/ee/workflows/lib/constants.ts`
- NOT in the webhooks directory

When working on workflow triggers, do not reference or use webhook trigger implementations - they are distinct systems.
