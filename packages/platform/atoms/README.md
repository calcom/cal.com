### Versioning
1. We use semantic versioning meaning that all updates except major should be safe to update.
2. If there are breaking changes within a specific version it will be marked as `❗️Breaking change` in the changelog, so please check it out before updating.
3. Some of the versions are suffixed e.g. `1.0.102-framer` and are intended for isolated use cases, so you most probably
want to use version without any suffix e.g. `1.0.103`.
