{DESCRIPTION}

### AI that means business

#### Any device, anytime
Whether you’re in different rooms, different continents, or different devices, you can join a video conference on Dialpad Ai Meetings using any device, from Mac to PC to iOS to Android

### Robust meeting controls
Dialpad Ai Meetings gives every single meeting participant the ability to turn their turn video (and mic) functionality on or off at any time. So whether it’s bad lighting, bad hair, or just a bad time to be on camera, you can still participate in every meeting.

### Easy screen sharing
Share your screen from any device. Your guests don't have to download the app either. Dialpad lets you send an SMS message with a link to your screen share, which they can join from a web browser!

### Smooth moves
Dialpad Ai Meetings automatically adjusts the video resolution based on your available bandwidth.

### No meeting-crashers allowed
The host can mute participants, limit screen sharing, remove unwanted guests, admit guests from a virtual waiting room, and also lock the video conference.
