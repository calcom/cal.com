Google Calendar is a time management and scheduling service developed by Google. Allows users to create and edit events, with options available for type and time. Available to anyone that has a Gmail account on both mobile and web versions.

## New Feature: Default Notification Times

Cal.com now allows users to set default Google Calendar notifications for events booked through the platform. Users can select preferred notification times (e.g., 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour before the event) that automatically apply to all events created via Cal.com bookings. This ensures consistency in how notifications are handled, reducing missed appointments.
