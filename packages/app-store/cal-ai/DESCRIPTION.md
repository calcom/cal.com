{DESCRIPTION}

## Example questions:

- "Book a meeting with @cal-user this week at a good time"
- "Find a time to meet with not-a-cal-user@gmail.com this week"
- "Move my meeting with [Someone's Name] to next week"
- "What does my week look like?"
- "When is my next meeting?"
- "What is my least busy day next week?"
- "Cancel the meeting with [Someone's Name]"
- "Reschedule the meeting with not-a-cal-user@gmail.com"
- "Is @cal-user busy on Friday at noon?"
- "Move my meeting at 2pm tomorrow to next week on Friday at 5pm"

### Or, any of that in a thread:
- What meetings do I have this week?
  - Meeting 1, Meeting 2
- Cancel that first meeting


### Or, doing multiple things:
- Cancel all my meetings tomorrow then book a quick chat with @joe at noon, a long meeting with @jane at 1 (both tomorrow). Also see if Toby is down to grab dinner this week (toby@gmail.com). Finally send me my updated agenda of everything I have coming up in the next couple days.
