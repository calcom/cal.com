Caldav is a protocol that allows different clients/servers to access scheduling information on remote servers as well as schedule meetings with other users on the same server or other servers. It extends WebDAV specification and uses iCalendar format for the data.

Confirmed and verified list of all supported CalDAV integration calendar services so far:

- ✅ Baïkal
- ✅ Kerio Connect
- ✅ Nextcloud
- ✅ Radicale

Every CalDav Provider is different and needs minor adjustments.

Follow our CalDav Roadmap here: <a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/issues/3457">https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/issues/3457</a>.

If your CalDav connection is not working, please try another Calendar provider (Google Mail or another CalDav).
