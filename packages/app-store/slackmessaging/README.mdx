Slack is a proprietary business communication platform that includes many IRC (internet relay chat) features - these include channels, private groups, direct messaging and more. Users are able to send pictures, and videos as well as even hop on calls with others using the paid version. Slack is available via desktop app, web browser or mobile app. The Cal.com Slack App can be used to display your links, upcoming bookings or to create events. Use it with your team members in a Slack, in a Community Slack or even with external contributors in a Slack Connect Channel.
