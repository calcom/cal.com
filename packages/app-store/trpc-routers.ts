// TODO: Generate this file automatically. This supposed to contain trpc-routes from all the apps automatically imported here and then exported.
// Can't use this file right now as I am not able to figure out how to keep getting tRPC typesafety with merge calls done on already created router
// Till that time import routers from each app directly to core.
// import { Router } from "@trpc/server/dist/declarations/src/router";
