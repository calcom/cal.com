# Waitlistbot

Never lose revenue from last-minute cancellations. Waitlistbot automatically notifies your waitlist members when appointment slots become available.

- 📅 **Smart Scheduling** - Prioritize by wait time, preferences, or custom rules
- 🔗 **Enhanced Booking Links** - Drop-in replacement for your Cal.com links

## How It Works

<Steps>

### Connect Your Cal.com Account

Click "Connect" and authorize Waitlistbot to access your Cal.com bookings.

### Generate Your Waitlist Link

We automatically create a waitlist-enhanced version of your booking link:
`waitlistbot.com/book/your-username/your-event/calcom`

### Share Your Link

Replace your Cal.com link with the Waitlistbot link anywhere you share it - email signatures, website, social media.

When someone cancels, Waitlistbot instantly notifies waitlist members who can book the newly available slot.
