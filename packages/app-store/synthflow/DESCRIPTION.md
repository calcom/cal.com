{DESCRIPTION}

One of the best ways for a service business to create and close more customers is to respond to inbound leads as quickly as possible. However, it's often impractical to have someone available to answer calls around the clock. Synthflow makes it possible for all businesses, regardless of size and technical know-how, to automate inbound and outbound phone calls with voice AI.
