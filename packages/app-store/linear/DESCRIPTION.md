{DESCRIPTION}

### Overview

The Linear integration with Google calendar allows you to connect your calendar and automate your status. If your teammates need to know whether you’re out of office, now they will.

### How it works

Once connected, your Linear status will detect out of office events in Google calendar and update your status when those events are upcoming or active.

### To Configure

Install Google Calendar from your Linear settings under My Account > Linked accounts.

Connect your account and sign into your Google account to allow access.

Success! Your calendar is connected and will update your Linear status with out of office notices.
