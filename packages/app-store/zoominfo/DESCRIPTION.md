ZoomInfo is the leading B2B intelligence platform that provides comprehensive data on companies and contacts. This integration automatically enriches attendee data for every booking with valuable business intelligence.

When installed and enabled on an event type, ZoomInfo will enrich attendee information when bookings are created. The enriched data includes:

- Contact details (name, email, phone, job title)
- Company information (name, industry, revenue, employee count)
- Professional context (job function, management level)
- Social profiles (LinkedIn URL)

This enriched data is displayed only to the host on the bookings page and booking success page, helping you prepare for meetings with valuable context about your attendees.
