/**
 * Abstract base payload builder classes.
 *
 * These define the interfaces that version-specific builders must implement.
 * They do NOT contain version-specific payload logic - that belongs in
 * the versioned/ directory.
 *
 * When creating a new webhook version:
 * 1. Create a new directory: versioned/v{NEW_VERSION}/
 * 2. Create concrete builder classes that extend these base classes
 * 3. Implement the abstract build() method with version-specific payload logic
 * 4. Register the new version in registry.ts
