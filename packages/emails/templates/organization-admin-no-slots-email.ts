Hi Admins,

It has been brought to our attention that ${this.adminNoSlots.user} has not had availability users have visited ${this.adminNoSlots.user}/${this.adminNoSlots.slug}.

Thereâ€™s a few reasons why this could be happening
The user does not have any calendars connected
Their schedules attached to this event are not enabled

We recommend checking their availability to resolve this
