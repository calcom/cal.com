          PR Branch: ${PR_BRANCH}

          ${CLONE_INSTRUCTIONS}

          Your tasks:
          1. Clone the repository as described above.
          2. Check out the PR branch: ${PR_BRANCH}
          3. Review the current state of the PR and understand what it's trying to accomplish.
          4. Read the PR description and any comments/review feedback on the PR.
          5. Complete any unfinished work on the PR:
             - Fix any issues mentioned in review comments
             - Ensure the code follows the repository's coding standards
             - Add any missing tests if applicable
             - Fix any linting or type errors
          6. Run the appropriate checks (lint, type-check, tests) to ensure the PR is ready for review.
          7. Commit your changes with clear commit messages.
          8. Push your changes to the PR branch.
          9. Post a summary comment on the PR explaining what you completed.
          10. Remove the 'stale' label from the PR if you've completed the work.
          11. Mark the PR as ready for review if applicable.

          Rules and Guidelines:
          1. Respect the original author's intent and approach - don't rewrite the PR from scratch.
          2. Make minimal, focused changes that complete the PR's original goal.
          3. Follow the existing code style and conventions in the repository.
          4. If the PR's original approach seems fundamentally flawed, explain why in a comment instead of making major changes.
          5. Never ask for user confirmation. Never wait for user messages.
          6. Credit the original author in your commit messages where appropriate."

          The original PR author (@${PR_AUTHOR}) has not been active on this PR for over a month and has not enabled 'Allow edits from maintainers', so we are migrating it to the main repository to complete the work.

          Original PR Details:
          - PR Number: #${PR_NUMBER}
          - PR Title: ${PR_TITLE}
          - Original Author: @${PR_AUTHOR}
          - Fork Repository: ${HEAD_REPO_FULL_NAME}
          - Fork Branch: ${PR_BRANCH}
          - Target Branch: ${BASE_BRANCH}

          Author Info for Co-author Attribution:
          - Name: ${AUTHOR_NAME}
          - Email: ${AUTHOR_EMAIL}

          Your tasks:

          1. Clone the main repository: ${REPO_NAME}
          2. Add the fork as a remote and fetch the PR branch:
             - git remote add fork https://github.com/${HEAD_REPO_FULL_NAME}.git
             - git fetch fork ${PR_BRANCH}
          3. Create a new branch in the main repo:
             - Branch name: community/pr-${PR_NUMBER}-${PR_BRANCH}
             - git checkout -b community/pr-${PR_NUMBER}-${PR_BRANCH} origin/${BASE_BRANCH}
          4. Cherry-pick or merge the commits from the fork branch:
             - Get the list of commits from fork/${PR_BRANCH} that are not in origin/${BASE_BRANCH}
             - Cherry-pick each commit, adding co-author attribution
             - For each commit, amend to add: \"Co-authored-by: ${AUTHOR_NAME} <${AUTHOR_EMAIL}>\"
             - Alternatively, if there are many commits, you can squash them into one commit with the co-author trailer
          5. Run lint and type checks to ensure the code is valid:
             - yarn lint
             - yarn type-check:ci
          6. Fix any issues that arise from the migration (merge conflicts, lint errors, etc.)
          7. Push the new branch to the main repository:
             - git push origin community/pr-${PR_NUMBER}-${PR_BRANCH}
          8. Create a new PR in the main repository:
             - Title: ${PR_TITLE}
             - Base branch: ${BASE_BRANCH}
             - Include the original PR description
             - Add a note at the top explaining this is a migration from fork PR #${PR_NUMBER}
             - Credit the original author @${PR_AUTHOR} in the PR description
          9. After successfully creating the new PR:
             - Close the original fork PR #${PR_NUMBER} with a comment explaining the migration
             - The comment should thank the original author and link to the new PR
             - Remove the 'stale' label from the original PR

          IMPORTANT - Co-author Attribution:
          Every commit you create MUST include the co-author trailer to credit the original author:

          Co-authored-by: ${AUTHOR_NAME} <${AUTHOR_EMAIL}>

          This ensures the original contributor gets proper credit for their work even though they are not a member of the ${REPO_NAME} repository.

          Rules and Guidelines:
          1. Preserve the original author's work as much as possible.
          2. Follow the existing code style and conventions in the repository.
          3. If the code has significant issues, fix them but document what you changed.
          4. Never ask for user confirmation. Never wait for user messages.
          5. If you encounter any blocking issues, document them in a comment on the original PR."
