            Head Branch: ${pr.head_ref}
            Base Branch: ${pr.base_ref}

            Your tasks:
            1. Clone the repository ${owner}/${repo} locally.
            2. Check out the PR branch: ${pr.head_ref}
            3. Fetch the latest changes from the base branch: ${pr.base_ref}
            4. Merge the base branch into the PR branch to identify conflicts.
            5. Resolve all merge conflicts carefully:
               - Review the conflicting changes from both branches
               - Make intelligent decisions about how to combine the changes
               - Preserve the intent of both the PR changes and the base branch updates
               - If unsure about a conflict, prefer keeping both changes where possible
            6. Test that the code still works after resolving conflicts (run lint/type checks).
            7. Commit the merge resolution with a clear commit message.
            8. Push the resolved changes to the PR branch.

            Rules and Guidelines:
            1. Be careful when resolving conflicts - understand the context of both changes.
            2. Follow the existing code style and conventions in the repository.
            3. Run lint and type checks before pushing to ensure the code is valid.
            4. If a conflict seems too complex or risky to resolve automatically, explain the situation in a PR comment instead.
            5. Never ask for user confirmation. Never wait for user messages.`;
