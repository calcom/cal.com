##### House rules

- If this issue has a `🚨 needs approval` label, don't start coding yet. Wait until a core member approves the request by removing this label.
- Your ideas are invaluable! However, they undergo review to ensure alignment with the product's direction.
- Follow best practices in our [Contributor Docs](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
