2. **Select the Attendee**
   - Click on the name or email of the attendee you wish to mark as "No-Show"

3. **Mark as No-Show**
   - From the dropdown menu, select "Mark as No Show"

4. **Unmark if Necessary**
   - If you marked an attendee as "No-Show" by mistake, you can easily undo it
   - Click on the name or email of the attendee again and select "Unmark as No Show"

### Handling Attendees grouped in 'n' more

For meetings with more than two attendees:

1. **Open the Checklist**
   - Click on "& n more" attendees. This will open a checklist

2. **Mark/Unmark Multiple Attendees**
