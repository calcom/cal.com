## Cal.com API
The Cal.com API is a REST-styled API that gives full control over the entire Cal.com platform by providing all the resources available to our customers, exposed as simple HTTP endpoints. The Cal.com API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
