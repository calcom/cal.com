title: Getting Embed Code Snippets
---

You can get code snippets for **React** or **HTML** and also configure many different aspects of embeds using the **Embed Snippet Generator**. The code snippet is automatically updated with the changes you make in it.

Here is how you can access it.

1. Click on three dots of the event type and click on the option `Embed`
