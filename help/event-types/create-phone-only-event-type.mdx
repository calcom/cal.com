title: Create a phone-only event type
---

> **Note:** This feature is currently only available for organization team event types.

To create a phone-only event type where attendees only need to provide their phone number, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to any team event type settings page and click on the "Advanced" tab.

2. In the "Booking questions" section, you'll need to modify two fields:

   ### Email Field
   <Frame>
    <img src="/images/EditEmailQuestion.jpg" />
    </Frame>
   - Click the "Edit" button next to the Email field
   - Uncheck the "Required" option
   - Click "Save"

   Then:
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/EmailToggle.jpg" />
    </Frame>
   - Toggle off "Show on booking page" to hide the email field completely

   ### Phone Number Field
   <Frame>
    <img src="/images/EditPhoneNumber.jpg" />
    </Frame>
   - Click the "Edit" button next to the Phone number field
   - Check the "Required" option
   - Ensure "Show on booking page" is toggled on
   - Click "Save"

3. After saving your changes, your booking page will now only show the phone number field as required:
   <Frame>
    <img src="/images/PhoneOnlyBookingPage.jpg" />
    </Frame>

This setup is perfect for scenarios where you only need the attendee's phone number for communication.
