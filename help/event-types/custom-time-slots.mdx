title: Custom time-slot intervals
---
Using the custom time-slot interval feature in your account settings, you can change the way your bookable appointment slots are displayed in your public booking page. The time slot intervals indicate the slots available for booking; therefore a smaller interval will mean lots of little slices, while a larger interval will mean a smaller amount of bigger durations.

This change allows you to have more freedom in case of long event types by increasing the number of potential slots available, and in case of small event types, you can put a good amount of breather between them.
