title: Event type slot display issues

When encountering discrepancies in slot availability on the cal.com event type/booking page, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem: **If Booking Slots Are Available When You Are Unavailable:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Connected Calendar">
- Review your connected calendar for events marked as "free" instead of "busy," particularly all-day events such as vacations or out-of-office days. Some calendar providers, like Google Calendar, default to marking such events as free.
- Navigate to your cal.com settings under “**Settings**” > “**Calendars**” and ensure that the calendar containing busy events is toggled to be checked by cal.com for conflicts.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Date Overrides">
- If you've set up date overrides in the availability settings, ensure they are configured correctly. Date overrides may override your availability for specific time periods.
</Step>
</Steps>
### If Booking Slots Are Unavailable When You Are Available:

<Steps>
<Step title="Review Connected Calendar">

- Check your connected calendar to confirm that events marked as free are indeed marked as busy during your desired booking times.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Time Intervals">

- Verify the time intervals set for your event type. If your availability starts or ends at non-standard intervals (e.g., 8:15 - 11:30), adjust the time intervals accordingly. By default, cal.com displays slots starting on the hour only. Increasing intervals to 30 or 15-minute increments will display additional slots. Refer to the **[time slot interval documentation](https://cal.com/docs/core-features/event-types/custom-time-slot-intervals)** for more information.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Buffer Times">

- Review buffer times applied before or after meetings. Buffers subtract time before or after a meeting, potentially affecting slot availability. Refer to the **[buffer time documentation](https://cal.com/docs/core-features/event-types/event-buffer#an-example)** for guidance.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Booking Frequency Limit">
- Ensure that the booking frequency limit is set appropriately. Adjust settings accordingly if there are restrictions on how frequently bookings can be made. Refer to the **[booking frequency documentation](https://cal.com/docs/core-features/event-types/booking-frequency)** for assistance.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Limit Future Bookings">
- Review the "Limit Future Bookings" setting to ensure it aligns with your availability preferences. Adjust this setting if necessary to allow for future bookings. Refer to the **[limit future bookings documentation](https://cal.com/docs/core-features/event-types/limit-future-bookings)** for more details.
</Step>
</Steps>
By following these steps and checking each aspect meticulously, you should be able to effectively identify and resolve issues with slot availability on the cal.com event type/booking page. If the problem persists, don't hesitate to contact cal.com support for further assistance.
