Follow these step-by-step instructions to configure your availability in Cal.com based on your individual preferences:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access availability settings">
    * Log in to your Cal.com account. * Click Availability in the sidebar. You’ll see your existing
    availability schedules, such as "Working Hours" or any other you’ve added before.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new availability schedule">
    * Click New in the top-right corner. * Enter a name for your schedule (e.g., "Test Availability"). * Click
    Continue to create your schedule. By default, the schedule is set to 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize your availability">
    * Enable/Disable Days: Toggle days on or off based on when you're available. For example, you can set
    availability until 1:00 PM on a Saturday. * Edit Times for Specific Days: Click a time box to adjust
    availability for specific days. For example, change Monday’s availability to 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. * Copy
    Times to Other Days: After setting times for one day, click Copy Times To and select other days (e.g.,
    Tuesday–Friday). * Add Multiple Time Slots: Add additional time slots to split your availability (e.g.,
    9:00 AM–11:00 AM and 5:00 PM–7:30 PM).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Day overrides">
    Use day overrides for special cases when your availability changes for specific dates. * Click Add an
    Override. Example: Choose a date (e.g., Wednesday) and mark yourself as completely unavailable. Overrides
    are automatically archived once the date has passed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust your time zone">
    Set a specific time zone for your availability. Useful if your availability changes when traveling to
    another country.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Troubleshoot availability issues">
    If you notice times not showing up as expected, click Launch Troubleshooter. This tool helps identify
    issues based on how Cal.com determines your availability.
