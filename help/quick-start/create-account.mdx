The easiest way to get started with Cal.com is on our website. We offer a generous free tier where you get unlimited scheduling with no limits and all of our features built for individuals, with the option to upgrade to a teams plan for collaboration features.

[Sign up here](https://cal.com/signup) to create your free account.

Most people will do this, but for full data ownership and control over your scheduling, you can [self-host Cal.com](https://cal.com/docs/self-hosting) on your own infrastructure.

To get started, head to [cal.com/signup](https://cal.com/signup), where you'll be able to enter your desired username (the part that comes after cal.com, like cal.com/bailey), your email and a password. Alternatively, you can sign up using your Google account, or using SAML SSO by clicking on the respective buttons.

Please note that if you choose a **premium username**, which is a username thatâ€˜s either short or a common name, it costs a monthly fee. This prevents username squatting and ensures that people and brands are often able to get their username without it being taken by someone. You can always start with a non-premium username and then upgrade later on from within the application.

Once you've signed up, you'll go through the new user onboarding flow. Click below to skip to that section of the documentation.
