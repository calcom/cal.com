<Info>Please note that if you choose a **premium username**, which is a username thatâ€˜s either short or a common name, it costs a monthly fee. This prevents username squatting and ensures that people and brands are often able to get their username without it being taken by someone. You can always start with a non-premium username and then upgrade later on from within the application.</Info>
