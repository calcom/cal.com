Webhooks offer a great way to automate the flow with other apps when invitees schedule, cancel or reschedule events, or when the meeting ends.

The webhook subscription allows you to listen to specific trigger events, such as when a booking has been scheduled, for example. You can always listen to the webhook by providing a custom subscriber URL with your own development work. However, if you wish to trigger automations without any development work, you can use the integration with Zapier which connects Cal.com to your apps.

<Note>
Please note that the webhooks can be associated with user as well as individual event types, including team event types.

### Creating a webhook subscription

To create a new webhook subscription, visit `/settings/developer/webhooks` and proceed to enter the following details:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Subscriber URL">
        This is the listener URL where the payload will be sent when an event trigger is activated.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Event triggers">
        You can choose which specific triggers to listen to. Currently available triggers include:
        - `Booking Cancelled`
        - `Booking Created`
        - `Booking Rescheduled`
        - `Booking Rejected`
        - `Booking Requested`
        - `Booking Payment Initiated`
        - `Booking Paid`
        - `Meeting Started`
        - `Recording Ready`
        - `Form Submitted`
        - `Meeting Ended`
        - `Instant Meeting Created`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Secret">
        You can provide a secret key with this webhook to [verify it](/docs/core-features/webhooks#verifying-the-authenticity-of-the-received-payload) on the subscriber URL when receiving a payload. This helps confirm whether the payload is authentic or has been tampered with. You can leave it blank if you don't wish to secure the webhook with a secret key.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Custom Payload">
        You have the option to [customize the payload](/docs/core-features/webhooks#adding-a-custom-payload-template) that you receive when a subscribed event is triggered.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Verifying the authenticity of the received payload
<Steps>
    <Step title="Add a new secret key to your webhook">
        Simply add a new **secret key** to your webhook configuration and save it.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Wait for the webhook to be triggered">
        The webhook will trigger when an event is created, cancelled, rescheduled, or when a meeting ends.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create an HMAC using the secret key">
        Use the **secret key** to create an HMAC, and update it with the webhook payload received to generate an SHA256 hash.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify the payload authenticity">
        Compare the hash received in the header of the webhook `(X-Cal-Signature-256)` with the one you created using the **secret key** and the body of the payload. If they don't match, the received payload has been adulterated and cannot be trusted.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding a custom payload template

Customizable webhooks are a great way reduce the development effort and in many cases remove the need for a developer to build an additional integration service.

An example of a custom payload template is provided here:

```json
{
  "content": "A new event has been scheduled",
  "type": "{{type}}",
  "name": "{{title}}",
  "organizer": "{{organizer.name}}",
  "booker": "{{attendees.0.name}}"
}
```

where `{{type}}` represents the event type slug and `{{title}}` represents the title of the event type. Note that the variables should be added with a double parenthesis as shown above. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the payload that you would receive via an incoming webhook, with an exhaustive list of all the supported variables provided below:
