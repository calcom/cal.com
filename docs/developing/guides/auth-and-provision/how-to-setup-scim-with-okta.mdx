## Mapping Okta Groups to Cal.com Teams

When provisioning groups to your organization, Okta groups can be mapped to teams within your organization, and users will be auto-assigned to these teams.

On `https://app.cal.com/settings/organization/dsync`, there is a table with the teams under your organization. Click on "Add group name" to map the Okta group to the team.

<Note>
The group name must be spelled exactly as it is shown on Okta.
</Note>

When you push the group to your organization, those users will automatically be added to the team.
