### Developing

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against. The changes on the `main`
branch are tagged into a release monthly.

To develop locally:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.
2. Create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```

3. Install yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

4. Install the dependencies with:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

5. Start developing and watch for code changes:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

### Building

You can build the project with:

```bash
yarn build
```

Please be sure that you can make a full production build before pushing code.

### Testing

More info on how to add new tests coming soon.

### Running tests

This will run and test all flows in multiple Chromium windows to verify that no critical flow breaks:

```bash
yarn test-e2e
```

### Linting

To check the formatting of your code:

```bash
yarn lint
```

If you get errors, be sure to fix them before committing.

### Making a Pull Request

- Be sure to [check the "Allow edits from maintainers" option](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) while creating you PR.
- If your PR refers to or fixes an issue, be sure to add `refs #XXX` or `fixes #XXX` to the PR description. Replacing `XXX` with the respective issue number. See more about [Linking a pull request to an issue
  ](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
- Be sure to fill the PR Template accordingly.

### Guidelines for committing yarn lockfile

Do not commit your `yarn.lock` unless you've made changes to the `package.json`. If you've already committed `yarn.lock` unintentionally, follow these steps to undo:

If your last commit has the `yarn.lock` file alongside other files and you only wish to uncommit the `yarn.lock`:
   ```git
   git checkout HEAD~1 yarn.lock
   git commit -m "Revert yarn.lock changes"
   ```
If you've pushed the commit with the `yarn.lock`:
   1. Correct the commit locally using the above method.
   2. Carefully force push:

   ```git
   git push origin <your-branch-name> --force
   ```

If `yarn.lock` was committed a while ago and there have been several commits since, you can use the following steps to revert just the `yarn.lock` changes without impacting the subsequent changes:

1. **Checkout a Previous Version**:
   - Find the commit hash before the `yarn.lock` was unintentionally committed. You can do this by viewing the Git log:
     ```git
     git log yarn.lock
     ```
   - Once you have identified the commit hash, use it to checkout the previous version of `yarn.lock`:
     ```git
     git checkout <commit_hash> yarn.lock
     ```

2. **Commit the Reverted Version**:
   - After checking out the previous version of the `yarn.lock`, commit this change:
     ```git
     git commit -m "Revert yarn.lock to its state before unintended changes"
     ```

3. **Proceed with Caution**:
   - If you need to push this change, first pull the latest changes from your remote branch to ensure you're not overwriting other recent changes:
     ```git
     git pull origin <your-branch-name>
     ```
   - Then push the updated branch:
     ```git
     git push origin <your-branch-name>
     ```
