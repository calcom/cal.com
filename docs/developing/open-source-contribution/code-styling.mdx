Keeping our code styles consistent is key to making the repository easy to read and work with.

We use a number of style guides written by other amazing companies, simply because they are widely used and because we like working with them.

We don't expect you to study every single rule of each style guide, but these are great reference points as to how your code should be styled. We may reject a pull request if your code style significantly differs from these style guides however.

### Biome
Cal.com now uses Biome for both linting and formatting. The repository already contains the configuration, so we recommend hooking Biome into your editor to keep code aligned with the project guidelines automatically.

### JavaScript/TypeScript
We use the
 for all JavaScript and Typescript code.

### HTML & CSS
We use the [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html) for any HTML and CSS markup. However, exceptions to the HTML guide apply where JSX differentiates from standard HTML.
