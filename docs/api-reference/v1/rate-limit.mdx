<Warning>
**API v1 is deprecated and will be discontinued on February 15, 2026.** Please migrate to [API v2](/api-reference/v2/introduction) as soon as possible.
</Warning>

We limit the number of calls you can make over a certain period of time. Rate limits vary and are specified by the following header in all responses:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Header</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>X-RateLimit-Limit</td>
      <td>The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>X-RateLimit-Remaining</td>
      <td>The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>X-RateLimit-Reset</td>
      <td>The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

When the rate limit is **exceeded**, an error is returned with the status **"429 Too Many Requests"**:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "too_many_requests",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
  }
}
```
