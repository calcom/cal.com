Cal.com uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, or something else failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Cal.com's servers (these are rare).
