## Requirements

Currently Vercel Pro Plan is required to be able to Deploy this application with Vercel, due to limitations on the number of serverless functions on the free plan.

You need a PostgresDB database hosted somewhere. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) offer a great free option while [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) offers a low-cost option.
