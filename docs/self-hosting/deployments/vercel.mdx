## Requirements

You need a PostgresDB database hosted somewhere. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) offer a great free option while [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) offers a low-cost option.

## Getting Started

### Local settings

<Steps>
    <Step title="Fork and clone the repository">
        ```
            git clone https://github.com/\<your-fork\>/cal.com.git
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set environment variables">
        Copy the `.env.example` file in `apps/web`, rename it to `.env` and fill it with your settings ([See manual setup](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com#manual-setup) and [Obtaining the Google API Credentials](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com#obtaining-the-google-api-credentials))
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install packages with yarn">        
        ```
        yarn install
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set up the database using the Prisma schema">
        Schema is located in at `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`.

        ```
        yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio)">
        To look at or modify the database content
        ```
        yarn db-studio
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open User model">
        Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create new user">
        Fill out the fields (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Login">
        Open a browser to [port 3000](http://localhost:3000/) on your localhost and login with your just created, first user.
    </Step>
</Steps>

Sometimes, yarn install might fail during deployment on Vercel, in which case, you can use ```YARN_ENABLE_IMMUTABLE_INSTALLS=false yarn install``` as the install command instead.
