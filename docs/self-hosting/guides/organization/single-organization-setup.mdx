This guide will walk you through setting up your cal.com instance to work with an organization using the same domain. 

Note that an organization's booking pages are by default accessible at `http://{orgSlug}.yourcalinstance.example/{CAL_LINK}` but with this setup, you won't need another domain, if you want to use just one organization.

## Step 1: Identify what slug you want to use for your organization

For a company with domain `yourdomain.com`, a good slug would be `yourdomain`.

## Step 2: Setup and create an organization

Follow the [Organization Setup](./organization-setup) guide to enable organizations feature. 

<Info>
Make sure to use the slug you decided in Step 1.

## Step 3: Add Environment Variable

Set the following environment variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
# yourdomain is the slug you decided in Step 1
NEXT_PUBLIC_SINGLE_ORG_SLUG=yourdomain
```

## Step 4: Restart Development Server

After making the configuration changes, restart your development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
