### Introduction

This image can be found on DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/calcom/cal.com.

Note for ARM Users: Use the {version}-arm suffix for pulling images. Example: `docker pull calcom/cal.com:v5.6.19-arm`.

### Contributing

The Docker configuration for Cal.com is an effort powered by people within the community. Cal.com, Inc. does not yet provide official support for Docker, but we will accept fixes and documentation at this time. Use at your own risk.

If you want to contribute to the Docker repository, [reply here](https://github.com/calcom/docker/discussions/32).

The Docker configuration can be found [in our docker repository](https://github.com/calcom/docker).

### Requirements

Make sure you have `docker` & `docker compose` installed on the server / system.

Note: `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, per the Docker documentation.

### Getting Started

1. Clone calcom-docker
    
    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/calcom/docker.git calcom-docker
    ```

2. Change into the directory
    
    ```
    cd docker
    ```

3. Prepare your configuration: Rename .env.example to .env and then update .env
    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Most configurations can be left as-is, but for configuration options see Important Run-time variables below.

    Update the appropriate values in your .env file, then proceed.

4. (optional) Pre-Pull the images by running the following command
    
    ```
    docker compose pull
    ```
5. Start Cal.com via docker compose

    (Most basic users, and for First Run) To run the complete stack, which includes a local Postgres database, Cal.com web app, and Prisma Studio:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    To run Cal.com web app and Prisma Studio against a remote database, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d calcom studio
    ```

    To run only the Cal.com web app, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d calcom
    ```

6. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), or your defined NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL. The first time you run Cal.com, a setup wizard will initialize. Define your first user, and you're ready to go!

### Update Calcom Instance

1. Stop the Cal.com stack

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

2. Pull the latest changes

    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```
3. Update environment variables as necessary.
4. Re-start the Cal.com stack

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

### Configuration

#### Build-time variables

These variables must be provided at the time of the docker build, and can be provided by updating the .env file. Changing these is not required for evaluation, but may be required for running in production. Currently, if you require changes to these variables, you must follow the instructions to build and publish your own image.

* NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL

* NEXT_PUBLIC_LICENSE_CONSENT

* NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEMETRY_KEY

#### Important Run-time variables

* NEXTAUTH_SECRET

### Troubleshooting

* SSL edge termination: If running behind a load balancer which handles SSL certificates, you will need to add the environmental variable `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to prevent requests from being rejected. Only do this if you know what you are doing and trust the services/load-balancers directing traffic to your service.

* Failed to commit changes: Invalid 'prisma.user.create()': Certain versions may have trouble creating a user if the field `metadata` is empty. Using an empty json object `{}` as the field value should resolve this issue. Also, the `id` field will autoincrement, so you may also try leaving the value of `id` as empty.
