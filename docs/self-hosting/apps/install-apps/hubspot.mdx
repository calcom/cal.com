## Event Type Options

### Associate contacts with

Choose how to handle HubSpot records when creating meetings. Meetings are always created under contact records. We search for records based on the attendee email.

**Options:**
- **Contact** - Create meetings under contact records only
- **Company** - Create meetings under contact records, and associate the contact with a company based on email domain

### Do not create new records for guests added to the booking

If this option is enabled, we will only handle creating meetings under the main attendee of the event and not additional guests.

### Skip creating contacts if they do not exist in HubSpot

<Note>This option is available when "Contact" is selected.</Note>

If the option is enabled, skip creating new contacts if they do not exist in HubSpot already. No meeting will be created if the contact doesn't exist.

## Appendix

### How we match companies

We determine if an attendee belongs to a company by extracting the email domain (e.g., `john@acme.com` → `acme.com`) and searching for a company with a matching `domain` property in HubSpot. If no company exists with the matching domain, we automatically create a new company with that domain as both its name and domain property.

### Meeting association

Meetings are always associated with contact records using the `meeting_event_to_contact` association. When the "Company" option is selected, contacts are additionally associated with companies using the `contact_to_company` association.
