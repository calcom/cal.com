The Conferencing Apps Atom allows users to seamlessly install applications such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams, enabling them to set these as default or optional locations for their events.

## User-Level Installation

Below code snippet can be used to render Conferencing Apps Atom for user-level installation:

```js
import { ConferencingAppsSettings } from "@calcom/atoms";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

export default function ConferencingApps() {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const callbackUri = `${window.location.origin}${pathname}`;

  return (
    <>
        <ConferencingAppsSettings returnTo={callbackUri} onErrorReturnTo={callbackUri} />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Organization & Team-Level Installation

You can also install conferencing apps at the organization or team level, providing shared credentials for all members.

### Benefits

- **No individual setup required**: Users within a team or organization no longer need to connect their personal accounts to Zoom or other conferencing apps.
- **Shared credentials**: Once installed by an admin, the conferencing app credentials are available for all sub-teams and users within the organization.
- **Reduced redundancy**: Instead of every user configuring the same app, the admin installs it once and all members can use it seamlessly.
- **Flexible usage**: Users can leverage the shared team/org-installed credentials when creating personal events, as well as team events.

### Team-Level Installation

Install conferencing apps at the team level by passing both `orgId` (parent organization) and `teamId` (child team) as props:

```js
import { ConferencingAppsSettings } from "@calcom/atoms";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

export default function TeamConferencingApps() {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const callbackUri = `${window.location.origin}${pathname}`;
  const orgId = 123; // Parent organization ID
  const teamId = 456; // Child team ID

  return (
    <>
        <ConferencingAppsSettings 
          returnTo={callbackUri} 
          onErrorReturnTo={callbackUri}
          orgId={orgId}
          teamId={teamId}
        />
    </>
  )
}
```

**Who can use team-installed apps:**
- All members of this team can use the credentials on their team events (collective, round robin)
- All team members can also use these credentials on their personal events

### Organization-Level Installation

Install conferencing apps at the organization level by passing only `orgId` (parent organization) as a prop:

```js
import { ConferencingAppsSettings } from "@calcom/atoms";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

export default function OrgConferencingApps() {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const callbackUri = `${window.location.origin}${pathname}`;
  const orgId = 123; // Parent organization ID

  return (
    <>
        <ConferencingAppsSettings 
          returnTo={callbackUri} 
          onErrorReturnTo={callbackUri}
          orgId={orgId}
        />
    </>
  )
}
```

**Who can use org-installed apps:**
- All members within the organization
- All members of all teams within the organization
- Can be used on personal events and all team events (collective, round robin) for all teams within the organization
