The Create Schedule atom provides a simple dialog interface for users to create new availability
schedules. Fully customizable with callback support for handling successful schedule creation.

Below code snippet can be used to render the Create schedule atom

```js
import { CreateSchedule } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function CreateSchedule() {
  return (
    <>
      <CreateSchedule
        name="Create new schedule"
        customClassNames={{
          createScheduleButton: "bg-red-500 border-none my-4 mx-2 rounded-md",
        }}
      />
    </>
  )

For developers who don't want the dialog-based interface, we provide a `CreateScheduleForm` atom to integrate the schedule
creation form directly into your own UI. This headless approach gives you full flexibility to
handle layout, styling, and user flow exactly how you need it.

Below code snippet can be used to render the Create schedule form atom

```js
import { CreateScheduleForm } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function CreateScheduleForm() {
  return (
    <>
      <CreateScheduleForm
        customClassNames={{
          atomsWrapper: "border-black border-[1px] w-[500px] my-10 mx-5 rounded-md px-5 py-5",
          buttons: {
            continue: "bg-red-400 border-none",
            container: "justify-start",
          },
        }}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

<Note>
  Please ensure all custom classnames are valid Tailwind CSS classnames. Note that sometimes the custom
  classnames may fail to override the styling with the classnames that you might have passed via props. That
  is because the clsx utility function that we use to override classnames inside our components has some
  limitations. A simple get around to solve this issue is to just prefix your classnames with ! property just
  before passing in any classname.
