Google calendar connect supports integration for both single and multiple users. The above video demonstration showcases the integration for a single user. To enable integration for multiple users, simply pass the prop `isMultiCalendar` as `true`. This allows your application to handle multiple Google calendar accounts seamlessly, providing a more flexible experience for users who manage several calendars.

Below code snippet can be used to render the Google calendar connect button for multiple users

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function Connect() {
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.GoogleCalendar isMultiCalendar={true} />
    </>
  )
}
```

For a demonstration of the Google calendar connect integration for multiple users, please refer to the video below.

<Note>
  Please ensure all custom classnames are valid Tailwind CSS classnames. Note that sometimes the custom
  classnames may fail to override the styling with the classnames that you might have passed via props. That
  is because the clsx utility function that we use to override classnames inside our components has some
  limitations. A simple get around to solve this issue is to just prefix your classnames with ! property just
  before passing in any classname.
