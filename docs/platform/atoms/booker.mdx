The booker atom is a dynamic component that facilitates the booking process for users. It allows individuals to easily select available time slots and confirm their participation in various events, streamlining the scheduling experience. It is one of the most important atoms and a critical piece of our scheduling system.

Below code snippet can be used to render the booker atom

```js
import { Booker } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function Booker( props : BookerProps ) {
  return (
    <>
      <Booker
        eventSlug={props.eventTypeSlug}
        username={props.calUsername}
        onCreateBookingSuccess={() => {
          console.log("booking created successfully");
         }}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

It is also possible to change the booker layout into a week or column view, you just need to pass in the view prop the layout you want to use. The layouts are as follows: **MONTH_VIEW,** **WEEK_VIEW** and **COLUMN_VIEW**. Both the week and column layouts come with an Overlay Calendar feature, which allows users to overlay multiple calendars on top of their primary calendar.

Below code snippet can be used to render the booker atom with week view

```js
import { Booker } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function Booker( props : BookerProps ) {
  return (
    <>
      <Booker
        view="WEEK_VIEW"
        eventSlug={props.eventTypeSlug}
        username={props.calUsername}
        onCreateBookingSuccess={() => {
          console.log("booking created successfully");
         }}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```
