title: "Cal OAuth Provider"
---

Cal OAuth Provider is used to setup Cal Atoms within your app after your users have authenticated using your Cal OAuth 2.0 client.

Your users will have authenticated with your Cal OAuth client and you will have access to their access tokens, which
the Cal Atoms will use to manage their event type settings, availability, etc. within your app.

It is used in the root of your app, be it _app.js or _app.tsx in case of
Next.js or App.js or App.ts in case of React. Here is an example:


```js
import "@calcom/atoms/globals.min.css";
import { CalOAuthProvider } from '@calcom/atoms';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const accessToken = "user-oauth-access-token";

  return (
    <CalOAuthProvider
      accessToken={accessToken}
      clientId={process.env.CAL_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID ?? ""}
      options={{
        apiUrl: process.env.CAL_API_URL ?? "https://api.cal.com/v2",
        refreshUrl: process.env.REFRESH_URL
      }}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </CalOAuthProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

Below is a list of props that can be passed to the Cal OAuth Provider.
