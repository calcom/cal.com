The event type atom enables a user to create events that others can use to book them. The events can be created for an individual or a team. However, a team event type can only be created by a team admin or owner.

## Individual event type

Below code snippet can be used to render the create event type atom, which is a form with all the required input fields needed to create an event type.

```js
import { CreateEventType } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function EventType() {
  return (
    <>
      <CreateEventType
        onSuccess={(eventType) => {
          console.log("EventType created successfully", eventType);
        }}
        customClassNames={{
          atomsWrapper: "border p-4 rounded-md",
          buttons: { submit: "bg-red-500", cancel: "bg-gray-300" },
        }}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

For creating an event type for a team, you need to provide the team id of your particular team as a prop to the create event type atom. Also note that a team event type can only be created by a team admin or owner.

Below code snippet can be used to render the create event type atom for a team.

```js
import { CreateEventType } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function TeamEventType(teamId: number) {l
  return (
    <>
      <CreateEventType
        teamId={teamId}
        onSuccess={(eventType) => {
          console.log("EventType created successfully", eventType);
        }}
        customClassNames={{
          atomsWrapper: "border p-4 rounded-md",
          buttons: { submit: "bg-red-500", cancel: "bg-gray-300" },
        }}

The availability tab allows users to manage their scheduling preferences effectively. Within this tab, users can edit their existing availability or set new availability options based on the preferences they have previously established.

For team event types, availability for a specific event can also be configured for the entire team based on a common schedule. Otherwise each host can be assigned their own specific availability based on their schedules.

**3. Assignment**

The assignment tab is only available for team event types. It lets you configure what kind of scheduling you want to enable for your team event, where you can choose from a collective, round robin or managed event. You can also choose who amongst your team can or cannot attend the event.

The limits tab lets you configure how often you can be booked. You can add a lot of configurations via this tab, such as a buffer time before or after the event and a minimum notice period. 

Also if you want to select how many time a particular event can be booked, or how far in the future the event can be booked that is also possible. Or if you want to limit the event to a specific amount of time, that can also be done via the limits tab.
