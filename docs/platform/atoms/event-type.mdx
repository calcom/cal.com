The event type atom enables a user to create events that others can use to book them. The events can be created for an individual or a team. However, a team event type can only be created by a team admin or owner.

## Individual event type

Below code snippet can be used to render the create event type atom, which is a form with all the required input fields needed to create an event type.

```js
import { CreateEventType } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function EventType() {
  return (
    <>
       <CreateEventType
          onSuccess={(eventType) => {
            console.log("EventType created successfully", eventType);
          }}
          customClassNames={{
            atomsWrapper: "border p-4 rounded-md",
            buttons: { submit: "bg-red-500", cancel: "bg-gray-300" },
          }}
       />
    <>
  )
}
```

## Team event type

For creating an event type for a team, you need to provide the team id of your particular team as a prop to the create event type atom.

Below code snippet can be used to render the create event type atom for a team.

```js
import { CreateEventType } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function TeamEventType(teamId: number) {
  return (
    <>
       <CreateEventType
          teamId={teamId}
          onSuccess={(eventType) => {
            console.log("EventType created successfully", eventType);
          }}
          customClassNames={{
            atomsWrapper: "border p-4 rounded-md",
            buttons: { submit: "bg-red-500", cancel: "bg-gray-300" },
          }}
       />
    <>
