title: "Stripe connect"
---

The Stripe connect integration allows users to effortlessly connect their Stripe account for payment processing. This enables users to accept payments for their bookings, with automatic payment collection and processing through Stripe's secure platform.

## Ways to connect Stripe

There are two ways to connect your Stripe account in Cal.com platform integrations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Direct Stripe Connect atom">
    Use the standalone Stripe Connect button atom to provide a dedicated connection interface. This is ideal when you want to give users a specific place to manage their Stripe connection.

    Below code snippet can be used to render the Stripe connect button:

    ```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe />
    </>
  );
}
```

    The Stripe connect atom provides a seamless way to integrate Stripe payment processing. When clicked, the button redirects users to Stripe's OAuth consent page where they can authorize Cal.com to access their Stripe account. Once connected, users can start accepting payments for their bookings.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Event Type Settings payment tab">
    Use the Event Type Settings component with the payments tab enabled. This approach integrates Stripe connection directly into the event type configuration flow, allowing users to set up payments while configuring their event types.

    Below code snippet can be used to render the Event Type Settings with the payments tab:

    ```js
import { EventTypeSettings } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function EventType() {
  const eventTypeId = 123; // Your event type ID
  
  return (
    <>
      <EventTypeSettings 
        id={eventTypeId} 
        allowDelete={true}
        tabs={["setup", "availability", "team", "limits", "advanced", "recurring", "payments"]}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

    The Event Type Settings component includes a payments tab where users can connect their Stripe account and configure payment settings (price, currency, etc.) all in one place. This provides a more integrated experience when setting up paid event types.

## Advanced usage

### Custom labels

You can customize the button labels for different states (default, loading, and already connected):

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe 
        label="Connect to Stripe"
        loadingLabel="Checking connection..."
        alreadyConnectedLabel="Stripe Connected"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Redirect URLs

You can specify custom redirect URLs for successful connections and error scenarios:

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe 
        redir="/dashboard/payments"
        errorRedir="/dashboard/settings"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Team integration

For team-based Stripe connections, pass the `teamId` prop:

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  const teamId = 123; // Your team ID
  
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe teamId={teamId} />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Handling connection status

You can use callback functions to handle connection check success and errors:

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  const handleCheckSuccess = () => {
    console.log("Stripe connection verified successfully");
  };

  const handleCheckError = (error) => {
    console.error("Error checking Stripe connection:", error);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe 
        onCheckSuccess={handleCheckSuccess}
        onCheckError={handleCheckError}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Custom styling

You can customize the appearance of the button using the `className`, `icon`, and `color` props:

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe 
        className="!bg-purple-600 hover:!bg-purple-700"
        icon="credit-card"
        color="secondary"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Props

We offer all kinds of customizations to the Stripe connect via props. Below is a list of props that can be passed to the Stripe connect.

| alreadyConnectedLabel | No       | Label to display when atom is in already connected state                                  |
| loadingLabel          | No       | Label to display when atom is in loading state                                            |
| onCheckError          | No       | A callback function to handle errors when checking the connection status                  |

| errorRedir            | No       | A custom redirect URL link where the user gets redirected after authentication failure    |
| initialData           | No       | Initial data to be passed for the connection check                                        |
| onCheckSuccess        | No       | A callback function to handle success when checking the connection status                 |

<Note>
  Please ensure all custom classnames are valid Tailwind CSS classnames. Note that sometimes the custom
  classnames may fail to override the styling with the classnames that you might have passed via props. That
  is because the clsx utility function that we use to override classnames inside our components has some
  limitations. A simple get around to solve this issue is to just prefix your classnames with ! property just
  before passing in any classname.
</Note>

## Integration with Payment Form

The Stripe connect atom works seamlessly with the Payment Form atom. First, connect your Stripe account using this atom, then use the Payment Form atom to process payments for bookings. For more information on accepting payments, see the [Payment Form documentation](/platform/atoms/payment-form).
