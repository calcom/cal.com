title: "Stripe connect"
---

The Stripe connect button is used to effortlessly connect a user's Stripe account for payment processing. This allows users to accept payments for their bookings, with automatic payment collection and processing through Stripe's secure platform.

Below code snippet can be used to render the Stripe connect button

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe />
    </>
  );
}
```

The Stripe connect atom provides a seamless way to integrate Stripe payment processing into your Cal.com platform integration. When clicked, the button redirects users to Stripe's OAuth consent page where they can authorize Cal.com to access their Stripe account. Once connected, users can start accepting payments for their bookings.

## Basic usage

The simplest implementation requires no additional props. The atom will handle the connection flow automatically:

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Custom labels

You can customize the button labels for different states (default, loading, and already connected):

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe 
        label="Connect to Stripe"
        loadingLabel="Checking connection..."
        alreadyConnectedLabel="Stripe Connected"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Redirect URLs

You can specify custom redirect URLs for successful connections and error scenarios:

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe 
        redir="/dashboard/payments"
        errorRedir="/dashboard/settings"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Team integration

For team-based Stripe connections, pass the `teamId` prop:

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  const teamId = 123; // Your team ID
  
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe teamId={teamId} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Handling connection status

You can use callback functions to handle connection check success and errors:

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  const handleCheckSuccess = () => {
    console.log("Stripe connection verified successfully");
  };

  const handleCheckError = (error) => {
    console.error("Error checking Stripe connection:", error);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe 
        onCheckSuccess={handleCheckSuccess}
        onCheckError={handleCheckError}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Custom styling

You can customize the appearance of the button using the `className`, `icon`, and `color` props:

```js
import { Connect } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function ConnectStripe() {
  return (
    <>
      <Connect.Stripe 
        className="!bg-purple-600 hover:!bg-purple-700"
        icon="credit-card"
        color="secondary"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Props

We offer all kinds of customizations to the Stripe connect via props. Below is a list of props that can be passed to the Stripe connect.

| alreadyConnectedLabel | No       | Label to display when atom is in already connected state                                  |
| loadingLabel          | No       | Label to display when atom is in loading state                                            |

| onCheckSuccess        | No       | A callback function to handle success when checking the connection status                 |

<Note>
  Please ensure all custom classnames are valid Tailwind CSS classnames. Note that sometimes the custom
  classnames may fail to override the styling with the classnames that you might have passed via props. That
  is because the clsx utility function that we use to override classnames inside our components has some
  limitations. A simple get around to solve this issue is to just prefix your classnames with ! property just
  before passing in any classname.

## Integration with Payment Form

The Stripe connect atom works seamlessly with the Payment Form atom. First, connect your Stripe account using this atom, then use the Payment Form atom to process payments for bookings. For more information on accepting payments, see the [Payment Form documentation](/platform/atoms/payment-form).
