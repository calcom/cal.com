description: Replace default cal.com toasts with your own

It is possible to disable default toasts for the `AvailabilitySettings` and `EventTypeSettings` atoms to then use hooks => callbacks
and listen for updates to then render your own toasts.

If we use the `AvailabilitySettings` atom, make changes and press "Save" a confirmation appears:

<img src="/images/platform/guides/replacing-toasts/availability-settings.png" />

We can disable them using `disableToasts` prop:

```js
<AvailabilitySettings
    disableToasts={true}
/>
```

Now when changes happen and Save is clicked the toast will not appear.

You can then create functions and pass them to hooks:
```js
<AvailabilitySettings
    disableToasts={true}
    onUpdateSuccess={updateSuccessHandler}
    onUpdateError={updateErrorHandler}
    onDeleteSuccess={deleteSucessHandler}
    onDeleteError={deleteErrorHandler}
/>
```
in case of success response is passed to your functions and in case of error and error.
