## Prefilling default booking fields
If you want to pre-fill name and email fields you can pass them to the Booker atom's defaultFormValues prop:
```js

<Booker
    defaultFormValues={{
        name: "bob",
        email: "bob@gmail.com",
    }}
/>
```

which will look like:

## Prefilling custom booking fields

We created an event type for managed user with custom text and select fields. Name and email fields are created by default. Here is the request:
<img src="/images/platform/guides/booking-fields/custom-fields/request.png" />

That looks in booker like:

Let's say you want that when someone is trying to book one of your managed users that the
booking fields should be pre-filled with some data. We see that one of the booking fields has slug `coding-language` and the other
`help-with`. To pre-fill them you pass their slugs and values to the Booker atom's defaultFormValues prop:

```js
<Booker
    defaultFormValues={{
        "coding-language": "cobol",
        "help-with": "refactoring"
    }}
/>
```

which now will populate the booking fields:
<img src="/images/platform/guides/booking-fields/custom-fields/prefilled.png" />

## Making pre-filled fields read-only
`disableOnPrefill` booking field property controls whether or not to make a booking field read only if we pass its value in the defaultFormValues prop. Here is an example request
where we create an event type with one booking field with "disableOnPrefill": true and the other with "disableOnPrefill": false:

<img src="/images/platform/guides/booking-fields/read-only/request.png" />

If we pass their values to the Booker atom:
```js
<Booker
    defaultFormValues={{
        "coding-language": "cobol",
        "help-with": "refactoring"
    }}
/>
```

then here is how it will look like in the Booker. The "What language will we peer code in" text field is read only:
