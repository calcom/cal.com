## Using `handleSlotReservation` for Custom Slot Selection Flows

If you want to trigger a custom action immediately when a user selects a timeslot (before the booking form appears), you can use the `handleSlotReservation` prop. This prop allows you to intercept the slot selection event, enabling you to run custom logicâ€”such as calling the reserve slot api's https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/slots/reserve-a-slot.

**Example usage:**

```tsx
<Booker
  handleSlotReservation={(timeslot) => {
    // Your custom logic here
    console.log("User selected timeslot:", timeslot);
    // For example, call the reserve slot api's etc. 
  }}
  // ...other props
/>
```

- When a user selects a slot, the `handleSlotReservation` function will be called with the selected timeslot as its argument.
- If you provide this prop, the default slot reservation flow will be interrupted until your custom logic is complete.
- This is useful for introducing custom slot reservation flows.
