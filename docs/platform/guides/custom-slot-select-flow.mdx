## Using `handleSlotSelect` for Custom Slot Selection Flows

If you want to trigger a custom action immediately when a user selects a timeslot (before the booking form appears), you can use the `handleSlotSelect` prop. This prop allows you to intercept the slot selection event, enabling you to run custom logic—such as opening a modal, redirecting to a payment page, or tracking analytics—before proceeding with the booking flow.

**Example usage:**

```tsx
<Booker
  handleSlotSelect={(timeslot) => {
    // Your custom logic here
    console.log("User selected timeslot:", timeslot);
    // For example, call the reserve slot api's  
  }}
  // ...other props
/>
```

- When a user selects a slot, the `handleSlotSelect` function will be called with the selected timeslot as its argument.
- If you provide this prop, the default slot reservation flow will be interrupted until your custom logic is complete.
- This is useful for introducing custom slot reservation flows.
