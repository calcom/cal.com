Cal.com allows you to subscribe to notifications using webhooks. You can use notifications both to run core functionality in your project and to monitor for undesirable events (like errors) so your application can handle them gracefully

Using webhooks, you can subscribe to notifications to specific events you are interested in. For example, you can subscribe to events when a user creates a booking, or when a booking is cancelled.

### Creating a webhook subscription

To create a new webhook subscription, visit `https://app.cal.com/settings/platform/webhooks` and proceed to enter the following details:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Subscriber URL">
    This is the listener URL where the payload will be sent when an event trigger is activated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Event triggers">
    You can choose which specific triggers to listen to. Currently available triggers include: - `Booking
    Cancelled` - `Booking Created` - `Booking Rescheduled` - `Booking Rejected` - `Booking Requested` -
    `Booking Payment Initiated` - `Booking Paid` - `Meeting Started` - `Recording Ready` - `Form Submitted` -
    `Meeting Ended` - `Instant Meeting Created` - `Booking No-show Updated` - `After Hosts Didn't Join Cal
    Video` - `After Guests Didn't Join Cal Video`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secret">
    You can provide a secret key with this webhook to [verify
    it](/docs/core-features/webhooks#verifying-the-authenticity-of-the-received-payload) on the subscriber URL
    when receiving a payload. This helps confirm whether the payload is authentic or has been tampered with.
    You can leave it blank if you don't wish to secure the webhook with a secret key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Custom Payload">
    You have the option to [customize the
    payload](/docs/core-features/webhooks#adding-a-custom-payload-template) that you receive when a subscribed
    event is triggered.
  </Step>
</Steps>
