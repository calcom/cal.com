## Authentication for Platform customers

**Platform customers must use OAuth authentication** - API keys are not supported. All data created through the API will be attached to your OAuth client, ensuring proper data ownership and isolation.

### OAuth client credentials (Required for Platform operations)

OAuth credentials are **required** for all Platform-specific operations. Without proper OAuth headers, your data will not be correctly associated with your OAuth client.

#### Getting your OAuth credentials

1. Access your OAuth credentials in the [Platform dashboard](https://app.cal.com/settings/platform)
2. Create an OAuth client if you haven't already
3. Note your Client ID and Secret Key

#### Using OAuth credentials

Pass these headers with **every Platform API request**:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cal.com/v2/platform/managed-users" \
  -H "x-cal-client-id: your_oauth_client_id" \
  -H "x-cal-secret-key: your_oauth_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "username": "newuser"
  }'
```

**Critical**: These headers ensure all created data (users, bookings, event types) is properly attached to your OAuth client.

#### When to use OAuth credentials

Use OAuth credentials for:

- **Managing managed users** - [Create](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/platform-managed-users/create-a-managed-user), [refresh tokens](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/platform-managed-users/refresh-managed-user-tokens)
- **Platform webhooks** - [Create webhooks](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/platform-webhooks/create-a-webhook)
- **Organization management** - [Teams](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/orgs-teams/create-a-team), [memberships](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/orgs-teams-memberships/create-a-membership), [team event types](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/orgs-event-types/create-an-event-type)

### Managed user access tokens

After creating a managed user, you'll receive access and refresh tokens. Store these securely in your database alongside the managed user ID.

#### Using managed user tokens

For managed user-specific operations, use the access token:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cal.com/v2/bookings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer managed_user_access_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### When to use managed user tokens

Use managed user access tokens for:

- **User schedules** - [Create/manage schedules](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/schedules/create-a-schedule)
- **User event types** - [Create/manage event types](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/event-types/create-an-event-type)  
- **User bookings** - [Get user's bookings](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/bookings/get-all-bookings)

#### Token management

- **Access tokens**: Valid for 60 minutes
- **Refresh tokens**: Valid for 1 year
- **Refreshing**: Use the [refresh endpoint](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/oauth/post-v2oauth-refresh)
- **Recovery**: [Force refresh tokens](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/platform-managed-users/force-refresh-tokens) using OAuth credentials

```bash
# Refresh tokens
curl -X POST "https://api.cal.com/v2/oauth/refresh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "refreshToken": "user_refresh_token"
  }'
```

## Available endpoints by plan

### Platform endpoints
Platform customers have access to:

1. **Platform-prefixed endpoints** (require OAuth credentials)
2. **Standard endpoints** like "Bookings", "Event Types" (require managed user tokens)
3. **Organization endpoints** (ESSENTIALS+ plan) - all "Orgs" endpoints except "Orgs / Attributes", "Orgs / Attributes / Options" and "Orgs / Teams / Routing forms / Responses"

### Organizations endpoints
Organization customers have all endpoints except "Platform" and "Teams" prefixed endpoints, and "Orgs / Orgs" (children organizations require Platform plan).

### Teams endpoints  
Teams customers have all endpoints except "Platform" and "Orgs" prefixed endpoints.

## Security requirements

- All API requests must be made over **HTTPS**
- HTTP requests will fail
- Requests without proper authentication will fail
- Store OAuth credentials and tokens securely
- Never expose credentials in client-side code or public repositories
