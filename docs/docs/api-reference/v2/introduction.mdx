## Platform endpoints
Platform customers have the following endpoints available:

1. Endpoints prefixed with "Platform".
2. Endpoints with no prefix e.g "Bookings", "Event Types".
3. If you are at least on the ESSENTIALS plan, then all endpoints prefixed with "Orgs" except "Orgs / Attributes", "Orgs / Attributes / Options" and "Orgs / Teams / Routing forms / Responses".

## Organizations endpoints
Organizations customers have all the endpoints except the ones prefixed with "Platform" and "Teams" and "Orgs / Orgs" because
children organizations are only allowed in the platform plan right now.

## Teams endpoints
Teams customers have all the endpoints except the ones prefixed with "Platform" and "Orgs".

## Authentication

The Cal.com API has 3 authentication methods:

1. API key (Teams and Organizations plans only)
2. **Platform OAuth client credentials** (Platform customers - required)
3. **Managed user access token** (Platform customers - required)

**Platform customers:** You must use OAuth authentication. API keys are not available for Platform plans. All data created through the API will be associated with your OAuth client, ensuring proper data ownership and isolation.

### 1. API key (Teams and Organizations only)

You can view and manage your API keys in your settings page under the security tab in Cal.com.

<img src="/images/i1600x899-DllqhV6w_3Vj_oxtjov.png" />

API Keys are under Settings > Security

Test mode secret keys have the prefix `cal_` and live mode secret keys have the prefix `cal_live_`.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication to the API is performed via the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cal.com/v2/bookings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

### 2. Platform OAuth client credentials (Platform customers)

**Critical for Platform customers:** OAuth client credentials ensure that all data created through the API is properly associated with your OAuth client. Without proper OAuth headers, data may not be attached to the correct client.

#### When to use OAuth client credentials:

- **Platform management operations:**
  - Managing managed users [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/platform-managed-users/create-a-managed-user)
  - Creating OAuth client webhooks [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/platform-webhooks/create-a-webhook)
  - Refreshing tokens of managed users [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/platform-managed-users/refresh-managed-user-tokens)
- **Organization and team operations:**
  - Managing organization teams [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/orgs-teams/create-a-team)
  - Adding managed users as team members [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/orgs-teams-memberships/create-a-membership)
  - Creating team event types [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/orgs-event-types/create-an-event-type)

#### How to use OAuth client credentials:

1. Get your credentials from the platform dashboard: https://app.cal.com/settings/platform
2. Each OAuth client has an ID and secret
3. **Always include both headers in your requests:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cal.com/v2/platform/managed-users" \
  -H "x-cal-client-id: YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID" \
  -H "x-cal-secret-key: YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "username": "newuser"}'
```

**Important:** Both `x-cal-client-id` and `x-cal-secret-key` headers are required for all Platform operations. Missing these headers will result in authentication failures and data not being properly associated with your OAuth client.

### 3. Managed user access token (Platform customers)

After creating a managed user, you receive access and refresh tokens. Store these securely in your database alongside the managed user's ID.

**Recommended database fields:**
- `calAccessToken` - The user's access token
- `calRefreshToken` - The user's refresh token  
- `calManagedUserId` - The managed user's Cal.com ID

#### When to use managed user access tokens:

Use the managed user's access token for operations on behalf of that specific user:

- **User-specific operations:**
  - Managing schedules [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/schedules/create-a-schedule)
  - Managing personal event types [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/event-types/create-an-event-type)
  - Accessing user's bookings [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/bookings/get-all-bookings)

#### How to use managed user access tokens:

Pass the access token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cal.com/v2/bookings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer MANAGED_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

#### Token management:

- **Validity:** Access tokens expire after 60 minutes, refresh tokens after 1 year
- **Refreshing tokens:** Use the refresh endpoint [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/oauth/post-v2oauth-refresh)
- **Token recovery:** If tokens are lost, force refresh them using OAuth client credentials [API reference](https://cal.com/docs/api-reference/v2/platform-managed-users/force-refresh-tokens)

```bash
# Refresh tokens
curl -X POST "https://api.cal.com/v2/oauth/refresh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"refreshToken": "REFRESH_TOKEN"}'
```

## Authentication Quick Reference

| Operation Type | Authentication Method | Headers Required |
|---|---|---|
| Platform management | OAuth client credentials | `x-cal-client-id`, `x-cal-secret-key` |
| User-specific actions | Managed user access token | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| Teams/Organizations (non-Platform) | API key | `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` |

**Platform customers:** Always ensure you're using the correct authentication method. Using OAuth client credentials ensures your data is properly associated with your OAuth client and maintains proper data isolation.
