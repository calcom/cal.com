## Platform endpoints
Platform customers have the following endpoints available:

1. Endpoints prefixed with "Platform".
2. Endpoints with no prefix e.g "Bookings", "Event Types".
3. If you are at least on the ESSENTIALS plan, then all endpoints prefixed with "Orgs" except "Orgs / Attributes", "Orgs / Attributes / Options" and "Orgs / Teams / Routing forms / Responses".

## Organizations endpoints
Organizations customers have all the endpoints except the ones prefixed with "Platform" and "Teams" and "Orgs / Orgs" because
children organizations are only allowed in the platform plan right now.

## Teams endpoints
Teams customers have all the endpoints except the ones prefixed with "Platform" and "Orgs".

## Authentication for Platform Customers

**Critical for Platform customers:** All data created through the API must be properly associated with your OAuth client. Using incorrect authentication will result in data being orphaned or inaccessible. Always use OAuth tokens as specified below.

The Cal.com API has 3 authentication methods:

1. API key (not for Platform customers)
2. **Platform OAuth client credentials** (required for Platform operations)
3. **Managed user access token** (required for user-specific operations)

### When to use OAuth client credentials

**Required for all Platform administrative operations.** These credentials identify your Platform application and ensure all created resources are properly linked to your OAuth client.

Use OAuth client credentials for:

- **Managing managed users** - Creating, updating, and managing users in your platform
- **Creating OAuth client webhooks** - Setting up webhooks for your application
- **Refreshing managed user tokens** - Maintaining user session validity
- **Organization and team management** - Creating teams, managing memberships, setting up team event types

**How to authenticate with OAuth client credentials:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cal.com/v2/platform/managed-users" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-cal-client-id: your_oauth_client_id" \
  -H "x-cal-secret-key: your_oauth_client_secret" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "username": "newuser"
  }'
```

**Where to find your OAuth credentials:**
1. Go to https://app.cal.com/settings/platform
2. Select your OAuth client
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

### When to use managed user access tokens

**Required for all user-specific operations.** These tokens represent individual users and ensure their data is properly scoped and secured.

Use managed user access tokens for:

- **User schedules** - Creating and managing availability
- **User event types** - Setting up booking pages and event configurations  
- **User bookings** - Accessing private booking data and managing appointments

**How to authenticate with managed user access tokens:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cal.com/v2/bookings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer managed_user_access_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Token lifecycle management:**

```bash
# Refresh an expired access token
curl -X POST "https://api.cal.com/v2/oauth/refresh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "refreshToken": "user_refresh_token"
  }'
```

**Important token details:**
- Access tokens expire after 60 minutes
- Refresh tokens expire after 1 year
- Always store both tokens securely in your database
- Use the refresh endpoint before tokens expire

### Token recovery

If you lose a managed user's tokens, recover them using your OAuth client credentials:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cal.com/v2/platform/managed-users/{userId}/force-refresh-tokens" \
  -H "x-cal-client-id: your_oauth_client_id" \
  -H "x-cal-secret-key: your_oauth_client_secret"
```

### API key authentication (not for Platform customers)

Platform customers should not use API keys. API keys are only for individual Cal.com users managing their own data.

For reference, API key authentication uses:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cal.com/v2/bookings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cal_live_your_api_key"
```

### Security requirements

- All API requests must be made over HTTPS
- Never expose OAuth credentials in client-side code
- Store tokens securely in your backend database
- Implement proper token refresh logic to maintain user sessions
