Cal.com OAuth lets your app request access to a user's Cal.com account and call API v2 on their behalf.
For a high-level overview, see the help article: https://cal.com/help/apps-and-integrations/oauth.

## Get an OAuth client
- Platform customers can create a client in the dashboard: https://app.cal.com/settings/platform/oauth-clients/create.
- If you do not yet have a platform subscription, start here: https://app.cal.com/settings/platform/new.

## OAuth flow (API v2)
1. Authorize the user (requires an active Cal.com session):
   `POST https://api.cal.com/v2/oauth/{clientId}/authorize` with body `{"redirectUri":"https://your.app/oauth/callback"}`.
   The response is a 302 redirect to your `redirectUri` with `code=...`.
2. Exchange the code for tokens:
   `POST https://api.cal.com/v2/oauth/{clientId}/exchange` with header `Authorization: Bearer <code>`
   and body `{"clientSecret":"<client secret>"}`.
3. Refresh tokens:
   `POST https://api.cal.com/v2/oauth/{clientId}/refresh` with header
   `x-cal-secret-key: <client secret>` and body `{"refreshToken":"<refresh token>"}`.

Access tokens are valid for 60 minutes and refresh tokens for 1 year. Store them server-side.

## Manage clients and users
Use API v2 to create and manage OAuth clients and managed users:
- `POST /v2/oauth-clients`
- `GET /v2/oauth-clients`
- `PATCH /v2/oauth-clients/{clientId}`
- `DELETE /v2/oauth-clients/{clientId}`
- `POST /v2/oauth-clients/{clientId}/users`

See the full [API reference](/api-reference/v2).

## Badges
Use the official "Continue with Cal.com" badge in your auth UI:

<img src="https://app.cal.com/continue-with-calcom-coss-ui.svg" alt="Continue with Cal.com" />
