To test API in your local instance, you have the following pre-requisites:

1. Cal.com repo clone. You can get it by following the instructions provided in [Installation](/developing-with-cal.com/local-development)
2. A staging license key that goes in as value for `CALCOM_LICENSE_KEY` in your root `.env` file.
    
    You can use the following as staging license key
    ```
    1a1f8138-0bfc-4f37-b4af-1e24fd145839
    ```
    
3. Next, you need to install API submodule by following the instructions provided in [API submodule](/developing-with-cal.com/local-development#api)
4. Start the cal.com server using `yarn dev` on localhost and create the test API keys by visiting `/settings/developer/api-keys`
5. Start the API server by running `yarn workspace @calcom/api dev` and start testing your API locally

<Info>By default, the app server runs on port 3000 and the API server runs on port 3003</Info>
