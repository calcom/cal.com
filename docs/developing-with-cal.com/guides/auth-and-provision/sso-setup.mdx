Cal.com supports both Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC), two of the industry's leading authentication protocols. We prioritize your ease of access and security by providing robust Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities. Whether you're looking for the XML-based standard of SAML or the lightweight OIDC, our platform is equipped to integrate smoothly with your preferred identity provider, ensuring both convenience and security for your users.

### Setting up SAML login

1. Create a SAML application with your Identity Provider (IdP) using the instructions here - [SAML Setup](/developing-with-cal.com/guides/auth-and-provision/sso-setup#saml-registration-with-identity-providers)

2. Remember to configure access to the IdP SAML app for all your users (who need access to Cal).

3. You will need the XML metadata from your IdP later, so keep it accessible.

4. Log in to your Organization Admin account and visit `settings/organizations/sso`.

5. Click on the `Configure` button for `SSO with SAML`.

6. You should see a SAML configuration section, copy and paste the XML metadata from step 3 and click on Save.

7. Your provisioned users can now log into Cal using SAML.

### SAML Registration with Identity Providers

This guide explains the settings you need to use to configure SAML with your Identity Provider. Once this is set up you should get an XML metadata file that should then be uploaded on your Cal.com self-hosted instance.

### Setting up OIDC login

1. Keep handy the Client Secret, Client ID and Well Known URL with you for the next step.
2. Visit `/settings/organizations/sso` and you should see something like this:

3. Click on Configure SSO with OIDC, and then enter the Client Secret, Client ID and Well known URL from the Step 1, and click save.

4. That's it. Now when you try to login with SSO, your OIDC provider will handle the auth.
