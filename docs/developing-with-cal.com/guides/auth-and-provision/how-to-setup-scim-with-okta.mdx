## Mapping Okta Groups to Cal.com Teams
When provisioning groups to your organization, Okta groups can be mapped to teams within your organization and users will be auto assigned to these teams.

On `https://app.cal.com/settings/organization/dsync` there is a table with the teams under your organization. Click on "Add group name" to map the Okta group to the team. 
<Note>
The group name must be spelt exactly as it is shown on Okta
</Note>
When you push the group to your organization then those users will automatically be added to the team.
