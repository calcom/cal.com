Possible issue:
- We won't be able to use already built calendar-cache when Delegation Credential is enabled because existing CalendarCache entries don't have userId set.

## Approach of always using SelectedCalendar.credentialId for CalendarCache even for DelegationCredentials
- Delete Credentials when DelegationCredential is disabled


TO Test
- New members beyond the batch size are processed
