# PR Testing & Validation Checklist

## Summary of Changes
This PR resolves authentication and calendar synchronization issues with Exchange delegation credentials, calendar cache handling, and batch processing for delegated calendars.

## Related Issues
- [ ] **TODO: Link this PR to all relevant issue numbers for bounty consideration**
- Issue #XXX: Exchange authentication error with delegation credentials
- Issue #YYY: Calendar cache not working with delegation
- Issue #ZZZ: Batch processing fails for new delegated members

## Key Fixes Implemented
1. **Exchange Delegation Credential Handling**: Fixed authentication flow to properly handle delegation credentials
2. **Calendar Cache with userId**: Updated CalendarCache to include userId for delegation credentials
3. **Credential Management**: Proper cleanup of credentials when delegation is disabled
4. **Batch Processing**: Ensured new members beyond batch size are processed correctly

## Testing Checklist for Maintainers & Reviewers

### 1. Exchange Delegation Authentication
**Test Scenario**: Verify delegation credentials authenticate correctly
- [ ] Enable Exchange calendar integration with delegation credentials
- [ ] Verify successful authentication without errors
- [ ] Check that delegated calendars appear in available calendars list
- [ ] Confirm no authentication errors in logs during sync
- [ ] Test token refresh flow for delegated access

**Expected Result**: Delegation credentials authenticate successfully without throwing auth errors

### 2. Calendar Cache Handling
**Test Scenario**: Validate calendar cache works with delegation credentials

#### 2a. Fresh Installation (No existing cache)
- [ ] Set up new Exchange calendar with delegation enabled
- [ ] Verify CalendarCache entries are created with userId populated
- [ ] Check that cache queries use credentialId from SelectedCalendar
- [ ] Confirm cache retrieval works for delegated calendars

#### 2b. Existing Cache Migration
- [ ] Test with existing CalendarCache entries (userId = null)
- [ ] Verify system handles legacy cache entries gracefully
- [ ] Check that new cache entries include userId
- [ ] Confirm no cache collision between users sharing credentials

**Expected Result**: Calendar cache functions correctly for both new and existing installations

### 3. Credential Enabling/Disabling
**Test Scenario**: Test credential lifecycle management

#### 3a. Disabling Delegation
- [ ] Start with active delegation credential
- [ ] Disable delegation credential in settings
- [ ] Verify associated credentials are deleted from database
- [ ] Confirm related SelectedCalendar entries are cleaned up
- [ ] Check that calendar cache entries are invalidated/removed

#### 3b. Re-enabling Delegation
- [ ] Re-enable delegation after disabling
- [ ] Verify fresh credential creation
- [ ] Confirm new CalendarCache entries with correct userId
- [ ] Test that calendars sync properly after re-enabling

**Expected Result**: Credentials are properly created/deleted based on delegation state

### 4. Batch Processing for Delegated Calendars
**Test Scenario**: Verify all members are processed regardless of batch size

#### Setup
- Create Exchange calendar with delegation enabled
- Add members exceeding the batch size limit (typically 50+)

#### Tests
- [ ] Process initial batch of members
- [ ] Verify second batch is triggered automatically
- [ ] Confirm all members beyond batch size are processed
- [ ] Check logs for batch processing completion messages
- [ ] Verify no members are skipped or missed
- [ ] Test with varying member counts: 49, 50, 51, 100, 150

**Expected Result**: All members are processed successfully, including those beyond the initial batch size

### 5. Integration & Regression Tests
**Test Scenario**: Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality

- [ ] Test non-delegated Exchange calendars still work
- [ ] Verify Google Calendar integration unaffected
- [ ] Test Outlook/Office 365 calendar integration
- [ ] Confirm calendar sync for regular (non-delegated) accounts
- [ ] Check that existing calendar cache continues working
- [ ] Test multi-calendar scenarios (mixed delegation and non-delegation)

### 6. Edge Cases & Error Handling
**Test Scenarios**: Validate robustness

- [ ] Test with invalid/expired delegation credentials
- [ ] Verify graceful handling of network timeouts
- [ ] Test rapid enable/disable toggling of delegation
- [ ] Check behavior with missing/corrupted cache entries
- [ ] Test with zero members in delegated calendar
- [ ] Verify handling of partially failed batch processing

### 7. Database & Performance
**Test Scenario**: Validate data integrity and performance

- [ ] Verify no orphaned CalendarCache entries
- [ ] Check for proper foreign key constraints
- [ ] Confirm credentials are not duplicated
- [ ] Test query performance with large cache tables
- [ ] Verify database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Check for any N+1 query issues in batch processing

## How These Changes Resolve the Issues

### Issue: Exchange Auth Error with Delegation
**Root Cause**: Authentication flow didn't properly handle delegation-specific token management
**Resolution**: Updated auth flow to use delegation-aware token handling and proper scope management

### Issue: Calendar Cache Not Working with Delegation
**Root Cause**: CalendarCache entries lacked userId, causing cache misses/collisions with delegation
**Resolution**: 
- Always use SelectedCalendar.credentialId for CalendarCache
- Populate userId in cache entries to prevent cross-user conflicts
- Gracefully handle legacy cache entries without userId

### Issue: Batch Processing Incomplete
**Root Cause**: Batch processing logic stopped after first batch without processing remaining members
**Resolution**: Implemented continuation logic to process all batches until all members are handled
