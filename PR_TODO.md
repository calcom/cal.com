# PR Testing & Validation Checklist

## Summary of Changes
This PR resolves authentication and calendar synchronization issues with Exchange delegation credentials, calendar cache handling, and batch processing for delegated calendars.

## Related Issues
- [ ] **TODO: Link this PR to all relevant issue numbers for bounty consideration**

## Key Fixes Implemented
1. **Exchange Delegation Credential Handling**: Fixed authentication flow to properly handle delegation credentials
2. **Calendar Cache with userId**: Updated CalendarCache to include userId for delegation credentials
3. **Credential Management**: Proper cleanup of credentials when delegation is disabled
4. **Batch Processing**: Ensured new members beyond batch size are processed correctly

## Testing Checklist for Maintainers & Reviewers

### 1. Exchange Delegation Authentication
**Test Scenario**: Verify delegation credentials authenticate correctly

- [ ] Enable Exchange calendar integration with delegation credentials
- [ ] Verify successful authentication without errors
- [ ] Check that delegated calendars appear in available calendars list
- [ ] Confirm no authentication errors in logs during sync
- [ ] Test token refresh flow for delegated access

**Expected Result**: Delegation credentials authenticate successfully without throwing auth errors

### 2. Calendar Cache Handling
**Test Scenario**: Validate calendar cache works with delegation credentials

#### 2a. Fresh Installation (No existing cache)
- [ ] Set up new Exchange calendar with delegation enabled
- [ ] Verify CalendarCache entries are created with userId populated
- [ ] Check that cache queries use credentialId from SelectedCalendar
- [ ] Confirm cache retrieval works for delegated calendars

#### 2b. Existing Cache Migration
- [ ] Test with existing CalendarCache entries (userId = null)
- [ ] Verify system handles legacy cache entries gracefully
- [ ] Check that new cache entries include userId
- [ ] Confirm no cache collision between users sharing credentials

**Expected Result**: Calendar cache functions correctly for both new and existing installations

### 3. Credential Enabling/Disabling
**Test Scenario**: Test credential lifecycle management

- [ ] Enable delegation for a calendar
- [ ] Verify credential is stored correctly with delegation settings
- [ ] Disable delegation
- [ ] Confirm credential is properly removed/cleaned up
- [ ] Re-enable and verify credential is recreated correctly

**Expected Result**: Credentials are properly managed through enable/disable cycles

### 4. Batch Member Processing
**Test Scenario**: Verify all delegated members are processed beyond batch size

- [ ] Add >25 members to a delegated calendar (beyond typical batch size)
- [ ] Trigger batch processing
- [ ] Verify ALL members are processed, not just first batch
- [ ] Check logs for continuation of batch processing
- [ ] Confirm no members are left unprocessed

**Expected Result**: All members are processed regardless of batch size limits

### 5. Multi-User Scenarios
**Test Scenario**: Test delegation with multiple users

- [ ] Set up delegation for User A
- [ ] Set up delegation for User B using same Exchange account
- [ ] Verify cache entries are user-specific (userId populated)
- [ ] Confirm no cache collision between users
- [ ] Test calendar sync for both users independently

**Expected Result**: Each user's delegation works independently without interference

### 6. Edge Cases
**Test Scenario**: Validate handling of edge cases

- [ ] Test with invalid delegation credentials
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling
- [ ] Test with expired tokens
- [ ] Confirm token refresh works correctly
- [ ] Test with zero members in delegated calendar
- [ ] Verify handling of partially failed batch processing

### 7. Database & Performance
**Test Scenario**: Validate data integrity and performance

- [ ] Verify no orphaned CalendarCache entries
- [ ] Check for proper foreign key constraints
- [ ] Confirm credentials are not duplicated
- [ ] Test query performance with large cache tables
- [ ] Verify database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Check for any N+1 query issues in batch processing

## How These Changes Resolve the Issues

### Issue: Exchange Auth Error with Delegation
**Root Cause**: Authentication flow didn't properly handle delegation-specific token management

**Resolution**: Updated auth flow to use delegation-aware token handling and proper scope management

### Issue: Calendar Cache Not Working with Delegation
**Root Cause**: CalendarCache entries lacked userId, causing cache misses/collisions with delegation

**Resolution**: 
- Always use SelectedCalendar.credentialId for CalendarCache
- Populate userId in cache entries to prevent cross-user conflicts
- Gracefully handle legacy cache entries without userId

### Issue: Batch Processing Incomplete
**Root Cause**: Batch processing logic stopped after first batch without processing remaining members

**Resolution**: Implemented continuation logic to process all batches until all members are handled
