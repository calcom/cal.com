1. Create React components for managing variable pricing in event type settings
2. Add UI for displaying dynamic pricing on booking pages
3. Show price breakdown during booking confirmation
4. Update admin dashboard to show revenue analytics by pricing rule

## Documentation and tests for Stripe integration
