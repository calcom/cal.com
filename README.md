<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project

<img width="100%" alt="booking-screen" src="https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/assets/8019099/407e727e-ff19-4ca4-bcae-049dca05cf02">

# Scheduling infrastructure for absolutely everyone

The open source Calendly successor. You are in charge
of your own data, workflow, and appearance.

Calendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. It made our lives massively easier. We're using it for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes, and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customization.

That's where Cal.com comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data.

## Stay Up-to-Date

Cal.com officially launched as v.1.0 on the 15th of September 2021 and we've come a long way so far. Watch **releases** of this repository to be notified of future updates:

![cal-star-github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8019099/154853944-a9e3c999-3da3-4048-b149-b4f73893c6fb.gif)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run Cal.com.

- Node.js (Version: >=18.x)
- PostgreSQL (Version: >=13.x)
- Yarn _(recommended)_

> If you want to enable any of the available integrations, you may want to obtain additional credentials for each one. More details on this can be found below under the [integrations section](#integrations).

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository (or fork https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/fork). If you plan to distribute the code, keep the source code public to comply with [AGPLv3](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/LICENSE). To clone in a private repository, [acquire a commercial license](https://cal.com/sales)

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git
   ```

   > If you are on Windows, run the following command on `gitbash` with admin privileges: <br> > `git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git` <br>
   > See [docs](https://cal.com/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-troubleshoot-symbolic-link-issues-on-windows#enable-symbolic-links) for more details.

2. Go to the project folder

   ```sh
   cd cal.com
   ```

3. Install packages with yarn

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Set up your `.env` file

   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in the `.env` file.
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `CALENDSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the `.env` file.

5. Setup Node
   If your Node version does not meet the project's requirements as instructed by the docs, "nvm" (Node Version Manager) allows using Node at the version required by the project:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   ```

   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:

   ```sh
   nvm install && nvm use
   ```

   You can install nvm from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

#### Quick start with `yarn dx`

> - **Requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed**
> - Will start a local Postgres instance with a few test users - the credentials will be logged in the console

```sh
yarn dx
```

#### Development tip

> Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=1` anywhere in your `.env` to get logging information for all the queries and mutations driven by **tRPC**.

```sh
echo 'NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=1' >> .env
```

#### Gitpod Setup

1. Click the button below to open this project in Gitpod.

2. This will open a fully configured workspace in your browser with all the necessary dependencies already installed.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)

#### Manual setup

1. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file. Replace `<user>`, `<pass>`, `<db-host>`, and `<db-port>` with their applicable values

   ```
   DATABASE_URL='postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<db-host>:<db-port>'
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>If you don't know how to configure the DATABASE_URL, then follow the steps here to create a quick local DB</summary>

   1. [Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and install postgres in your local (if you don't have it already).

   2. Create your own local db by executing `createDB <DB name>`

   3. Now open your psql shell with the DB you created: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d <DB name>`

   4. Inside the psql shell execute `\conninfo`. And you will get the following info.  
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39329182/236612291-51d87f69-6dc1-4a23-bf4d-1ca1754e0a35.png)

   5. Now extract all the info and add it to your DATABASE_URL. The url would look something like this
      `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/Your-DB-Name`. The port is configurable and does not have to be 5432.

   </details>

   If you don't want to create a local DB. Then you can also consider using services like railway.app or render.

   - [Setup postgres DB with railway.app](https://docs.railway.app/guides/postgresql)
   - [Setup postgres DB with render](https://render.com/docs/databases)

1. Copy and paste your `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` to `.env.appStore`.

1. Set up the database using the Prisma schema (found in `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`)

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate
   ```

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

1. Run [mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) to view emails sent during development

   > **_NOTE:_** Required when `E2E_TEST_MAILHOG_ENABLED` is "1"

   ```sh
   docker pull mailhog/mailhog
   docker run -d -p 8025:8025 -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog
   ```

1. Run (in development mode)

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

#### Setting up your first user

##### Approach 1

1. Open [Prisma Studio](https://prisma.io/studio) to look at or modify the database content:

   ```sh
   yarn db-studio
   ```

1. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
1. Fill out the fields `email`, `username`, `password`, and set `metadata` to empty `{}` (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.
   > New users are set on a `TRIAL` plan by default. You might want to adjust this behavior to your needs in the `packages/prisma/schema.prisma` file.
1. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and login with your just created, first user.

##### Approach 2

Seed the local db by running

```sh
cd packages/prisma
yarn db-seed
```

The above command will populate the local db with dummy users.

### E2E-Testing

Be sure to set the environment variable `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the correct value. If you are running locally, as the documentation within `.env.example` mentions, the value should be `http://localhost:3000`.

```sh
# In a terminal just run:
yarn test-e2e

# To open the last HTML report run:
yarn playwright show-report test-results/reports/playwright-html-report
```

#### Resolving issues

##### E2E test browsers not installed

Run `npx playwright install` to download test browsers and resolve the error below when running `yarn test-e2e`:

```
Executable doesn't exist at /Users/alice/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1048/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
```

### Upgrading from earlier versions

1. Pull the current version:

   ```sh
   git pull
   ```

1. Check if dependencies got added/updated/removed

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

1. Apply database migrations by running <b>one of</b> the following commands:

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate
   ```

   (This can clear your development database in some cases)

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

1. Check for `.env` variables changes

   ```sh
   yarn predev
   ```

1. Start the server. In a development environment, just do:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

   For a production build, run for example:

   ```sh
   yarn build
   yarn start
   ```

1. Enjoy the new version.

## Enabling Content Security Policy

- Set CSP_POLICY="non-strict" env variable, which enables [Strict CSP](https://web.dev/strict-csp/) except for unsafe-inline in style-src . If you have some custom changes in your instance, you might have to make some code change to make your instance CSP compatible. Right now it enables strict CSP only on login page and on other SSR pages it is enabled in Report only mode to detect possible issues. On, SSG pages it is still not supported.
