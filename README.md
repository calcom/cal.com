<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project

<img width="100%" alt="booking-screen" src="https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/assets/8019099/407e727e-ff19-4ca4-bcae-049dca05cf02">

# Scheduling infrastructure for absolutely everyone

The open source Calendly successor. You are in charge
of your own data, workflow, and appearance.

Calendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. It made our lives massively easier. We're using it for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes, and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customization.

That's where Cal.com comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data.

## Stay Up-to-Date

Cal.com officially launched as v.1.0 on the 15th of September 2021 and we've come a long way so far. Watch **releases** of this repository to be notified of future updates:

![cal-star-github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8019099/154853944-a9e3c999-3da3-4048-b149-b4f73893c6fb.gif)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run Cal.com.

- Node.js (Version: >=18.x)
- PostgreSQL (Version: >=13.x)
- Yarn _(recommended)_

> If you want to enable any of the available integrations, you may want to obtain additional credentials for each one. More details on this can be found below under the [integrations section](#integrations).

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository (or fork https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/fork). If you plan to distribute the code, keep the source code public to comply with [AGPLv3](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/LICENSE). To clone in a private repository, [acquire a commercial license](https://cal.com/sales)

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git
   ```

   > If you are on Windows, run the following command on `gitbash` with admin privileges: <br> > `git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git` <br>
   > See [docs](https://cal.com/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-troubleshoot-symbolic-link-issues-on-windows#enable-symbolic-links) for more details.

2. Go to the project folder

   ```sh
   cd cal.com
   ```

3. Install packages with yarn

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Set up your `.env` file

   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in the `.env` file.
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `CALENDSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the `.env` file.

5. Setup Node
   If your Node version does not meet the project's requirements as instructed by the docs, "nvm" (Node Version Manager) allows using Node at the version required by the project:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   ```

   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:

   ```sh
   nvm install && nvm use
   ```

   You can install nvm from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

#### Quick start with `yarn dx`

> - **Requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed**
> - Will start a local Postgres instance with a few test users - the credentials will be logged in the console

```sh
yarn dx
```

#### Development tip

1. Add `export NODE_OPTIONS=“--max-old-space-size=16384”` to your shell script to increase the memory limit for the node process. Alternatively, you can run this in your terminal before running the app. Replace 16384 with the amount of RAM you want to allocate to the node process.

2. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level}` to your .env file to control the logging verbosity for all tRPC queries and mutations.\
   Where {level} can be one of the following:

   `0` for silly \
   `1` for trace \
   `2` for debug \
   `3` for info \
   `4` for warn \
   `5` for error \
   `6` for fatal

   When you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level}` in your .env file, it enables logging at that level and higher. Here's how it works:

   The logger will include all logs that are at the specified level or higher. For example: \

   - If you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=2`, it will log from level 2 (debug) upwards, meaning levels 2 (debug), 3 (info), 4 (warn), 5 (error), and (fatal) will be logged. \
   - If you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3`, it will log from level 3 (info) upwards, meaning levels 3 (info), 4 (warn), 5 (error), and 6 (fatal) will be logged, but level 2 (debug) and level 1 (trace) will be ignored. \

```sh
echo 'NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3' >> .env
```

for Logger level to be set at info, for example.

#### Gitpod Setup

1. Click the button below to open this project in Gitpod.

2. This will open a fully configured workspace in your browser with all the necessary dependencies already installed.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)

#### Manual setup

1. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file. Replace `<user>`, `<pass>`, `<db-host>`, and `<db-port>` with their applicable values

   ```
   DATABASE_URL='postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<db-host>:<db-port>'
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>If you don't know how to configure the DATABASE_URL, then follow the steps here to create a quick local DB</summary>

   1. [Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and install postgres in your local (if you don't have it already).

   2. Create your own local db by executing `createDB <DB name>`

   3. Now open your psql shell with the DB you created: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d <DB name>`

   4. Inside the psql shell execute `\conninfo`. And you will get the following info.
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39329182/236612291-51d87f69-6dc1-4a23-bf4d-1ca1754e0a35.png)

   5. Now extract all the info and add it to your DATABASE_URL. The url would look something like this
      `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/Your-DB-Name`. The port is configurable and does not have to be 5432.

   </details>

   If you don't want to create a local DB. Then you can also consider using services like railway.app, Northflank or render.

   - [Setup postgres DB with railway.app](https://docs.railway.app/guides/postgresql)
   - [Setup postgres DB with Northflank](https://northflank.com/guides/deploy-postgres-database-on-northflank)
   - [Setup postgres DB with render](https://render.com/docs/databases)

1. Copy and paste your `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` to `.env.appStore`.

1. Set up the database using the Prisma schema (found in `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`)

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate
   ```

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

1. Run [mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) to view emails sent during development

   > **_NOTE:_** Required when `E2E_TEST_MAILHOG_ENABLED` is "1"

   ```sh
   docker pull mailhog/mailhog
   docker run -d -p 8025:8025 -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog
   ```

1. Run (in development mode)

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

#### Setting up your first user

##### Approach 1

1. Open [Prisma Studio](https://prisma.io/studio) to look at or modify the database content:

   ```sh
   yarn db-studio
   ```

1. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
1. Fill out the fields `email`, `username`, `password`, and set `metadata` to empty `{}` (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.
   > New users are set on a `TRIAL` plan by default. You might want to adjust this behavior to your needs in the `packages/prisma/schema.prisma` file.
1. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and login with your just created, first user.

##### Approach 2

Seed the local db by running

```sh
cd packages/prisma
yarn db-seed
```

The above command will populate the local db with dummy users.

### E2E-Testing

Be sure to set the environment variable `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the correct value. If you are running locally, as the documentation within `.env.example` mentions, the value should be `http://localhost:3000`.

```sh
# In a terminal just run:
yarn test-e2e

# To open the last HTML report run:
yarn playwright show-report test-results/reports/playwright-html-report
```

#### Resolving issues

##### E2E test browsers not installed

Run `npx playwright install` to download test browsers and resolve the error below when running `yarn test-e2e`:

```
Executable doesn't exist at /Users/alice/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1048/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
```

### Upgrading from earlier versions

1. Pull the current version:

   ```sh
   git pull
   ```

1. Check if dependencies got added/updated/removed

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

1. Apply database migrations by running <b>one of</b> the following commands:

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate
   ```

   (This can clear your development database in some cases)

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

1. Check for `.env` variables changes

   ```sh
   yarn predev
   ```

1. Start the server. In a development environment, just do:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

   For a production build, run for example:

   ```sh
   yarn build
   yarn start
   ```

1. Enjoy the new version.
<!-- DEPLOYMENT -->

## Deployment

### Docker

**Official support**: Our team will begin to officially support the Dockerfile and docker-compose resources in this
repository.

**Important**: Cal.com will **not** be supporting installations that use these Docker resources. While we provide and maintain the Docker configurations, support for Docker-based installations is the responsibility of the user.

This image can be found on DockerHub at [https://hub.docker.com/r/calcom/cal.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/calcom/cal.com).

**Note for ARM Users**: Use the {version}-arm suffix for pulling images. Example: `docker pull calcom/cal.com:v5.6.19-arm`.

#### Requirements

Make sure you have `docker` & `docker compose` installed on the server / system. Both are installed by most docker utilities, including Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.

Note: `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, per the Docker documentation.

#### (Most users) Running Cal.com with Docker Compose

If you are evaluating Cal.com or running with minimal to no modifications, this option is for you.

1. Clone calcom/cal.com

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git
   ```

2. Change into the directory

   ```bash
   cd cal.com
   ```

3. Prepare your configuration: Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and then update `.env`

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Most configurations can be left as-is, but for configuration options see [Important Run-time variables](#important-run-time-variables) below.

   **Push Notifications (VAPID Keys)**
   If you see an error like:

   ```
   Error: No key set vapidDetails.publicKey
   ```

   This means your environment variables for Web Push are missing.
   You must generate and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`.

   Generate them with:

   ```bash
   npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
   ```

   Then update your `.env` file:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ```

   Do **not** commit real keys to `.env.example` — only placeholders.

   Update the appropriate values in your .env file, then proceed.

4. (optional) Pre-Pull the images by running the following command:

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   ```

   This will use the default image locations as specified by `image:` in the docker-compose.yaml file.

   Note: To aid with support, by default Scarf.sh is used as registry proxy for download metrics.

5. Start Cal.com via docker compose

   (Most basic users, and for First Run) To run the complete stack, which includes a local Postgres database, Cal.com web app, and Prisma Studio:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   To run Cal.com web app and Prisma Studio against a remote database, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d calcom studio
   ```

   To run only the Cal.com web app, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d calcom
   ```

   **Note: to run in attached mode for debugging, remove `-d` from your desired run command.**

6. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), or your defined NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL. The first time you run Cal.com, a setup wizard will initialize. Define your first user, and you're ready to go!

#### Updating Cal.com

1. Stop the Cal.com stack

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

2. Pull the latest changes

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   ```

3. Update env vars as necessary.
4. Re-start the Cal.com stack

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

#### (Advanced users) Build and Run Cal.com

1. Clone calcom/docker.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git calcom-docker
   ```

2. Change into the directory

   ```bash
   cd calcom-docker
   ```

3. Update the calcom submodule. This project depends on the Cal.com source code, which is included here as a Git submodule. To make sure you get everything you need, update the submodule with the command below.

   ```bash
   git submodule update --remote --init
   ```

   Note: DO NOT use recursive submodule update, otherwise you will receive a git authentication error.

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and then update `.env`

   For configuration options see [Build-time variables](#build-time-variables) below. Update the appropriate values in your .env file, then proceed.

5. Build the Cal.com docker image:

   Note: Due to application configuration requirements, an available database is currently required during the build process.

   a) If hosting elsewhere, configure the `DATABASE_URL` in the .env file, and skip the next step

   b) If a local or temporary database is required, start a local database via docker compose.

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d database
   ```

6. Build Cal.com via docker compose (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 must be provided to allow a network bridge to be used at build time. This requirement will be removed in the future)

   ```bash
   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker compose build calcom
   ```

7. Start Cal.com via docker compose

   (Most basic users, and for First Run) To run the complete stack, which includes a local Postgres database, Cal.com web app, and Prisma Studio:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   To run Cal.com web app and Prisma Studio against a remote database, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d calcom studio
   ```

   To run only the Cal.com web app, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d calcom
   ```

   **Note: to run in attached mode for debugging, remove `-d` from your desired run command.**

8. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), or your defined NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL. The first time you run Cal.com, a setup wizard will initialize. Define your first user, and you're ready to go!

##### Build-time variables

If building the image yourself, these variables must be provided at the time of the docker build, and can be provided by updating the .env file. Currently, if you require changes to these variables, you must follow the instructions to build and publish your own image.

Updating these variables is not required for evaluation, but is required for running in production. Instructions for generating variables can be found in the [Cal.com instructions](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)

#### Troubleshooting

##### SSL edge termination

If running behind a load balancer which handles SSL certificates, you will need to add the environmental variable `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to prevent requests from being rejected. Only do this if you know what you are doing and trust the services/load-balancers directing traffic to your service.

##### Failed to commit changes: Invalid 'prisma.user.create()'

Certain versions may have trouble creating a user if the field `metadata` is empty. Using an empty json object `{}` as the field value should resolve this issue. Also, the `id` field will autoincrement, so you may also try leaving the value of `id` as empty.

##### CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR

If you experience this error, it may be the way the default Auth callback in the server is using the WEBAPP_URL as a base url. The container does not necessarily have access to the same DNS as your local machine, and therefor needs to be configured to resolve to itself. You may be able to correct this by configuring `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth`, to help the backend loop back to itself.

## Enabling Content Security Policy

- Set CSP_POLICY="non-strict" env variable, which enables [Strict CSP](https://web.dev/strict-csp/) except for unsafe-inline in style-src . If you have some custom changes in your instance, you might have to make some code change to make your instance CSP compatible. Right now it enables strict CSP only on login page and on other SSR pages it is enabled in Report only mode to detect possible issues. On, SSG pages it is still not supported.

## Single Org Mode

Refer to docs [here](./docs/self-hosting/guides/organization/single-organization-setup) for a detailed documentation with screenshots.
