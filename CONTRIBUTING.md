# Contributing to Cal.com

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

## House Rules (for PRs and Issues)

### üë• Prevent Work Duplication

Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already exists in the [Issues](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/issues) or [Pull Requests](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pulls).

### ‚úÖ Work Only on Approved Issues

For feature requests, please wait for a core team member to approve and remove the `üö® needs approval` label before you start coding or submitting a PR.

For bugs, security, performance, documentation, etc., you can start coding immediately‚Äîeven if the `üö® needs approval` label is present.

We highly value new feature ideas, but to maintain consistency in the product direction, they must go through a review and approval process.

### üö´ Don‚Äôt Just Drop a Link

Avoid posting third-party links (e.g., Slack threads or Linear tickets) without context. A GitHub issue or PR should stand on its own‚Äîreviewers shouldn‚Äôt have to chase information across multiple tools to understand the context.

### üëÄ Think Like a Reviewer

Put yourself in the reviewer‚Äôs shoes. What would you want to know if reading this for the first time? Are there key decisions, goals, or constraints that need clarification? Does the PR assume knowledge that isn‚Äôt obvious? Are there related issues or previous PRs that should be linked?

### üßµ Bring in Context from Private Channels

If the task originated from a private conversation (e.g., Slack), take a moment to extract the relevant details and include them in the GitHub issue or PR. Avoid sharing sensitive information, but make sure important reasoning is captured.

> Example:  
> ‚ÄúA user requested feature X to solve problem Y. I considered approaches A, B, and C, but chose C for the following reasons‚Ä¶‚Äù

### üìö Treat It Like Documentation

GitHub is a shared source of truth. Every issue and PR contributes to the long-term understanding of the codebase. Write clearly enough that someone‚Äîpossibly you‚Äîcan revisit it months later and still understand what happened and why.

### ‚úÖ Summarize Your PR at the Top

Even if the code changes are minor or self-explanatory, a short written summary helps reviewers quickly understand the intent. You can use GitHub Copilot‚Äôs auto-summarize feature, but make sure to verify it for accuracy and relevance.

### üîó Use GitHub Keywords to Auto-Link Issues

Use phrases like ‚ÄúCloses #123‚Äù or ‚ÄúFixes #456‚Äù in your PR descriptions. This automatically links your PR to the related issue and closes it once merged‚Äîkeeping everything traceable and organized.

### üß™ Mention What Was Tested (and How)

Explain how you validated your changes. It doesn‚Äôt need to be exhaustive‚Äîjust enough to give reviewers confidence that things were tested and work as expected.

> Example:  
> ‚ÄúTested locally with mock data and confirmed the flow works on staging.‚Äù

### üß† Assume Future-You Won‚Äôt Remember

Write with the future in mind. If there are trade-offs, edge cases, or temporary workarounds, document them clearly so they don‚Äôt get lost or misinterpreted later.
