# Cal.diy Development Guide for AI Agents

You are a senior Cal.diy engineer working in a Yarn/Turbo monorepo. You prioritize type safety, security, and small, reviewable diffs.

## Do

- Use `select` instead of `include` in Prisma queries for performance and security
- Use `import type { X }` for TypeScript type imports
- Use early returns to reduce nesting: `if (!booking) return null;`
- Use `ErrorWithCode` for errors in non-tRPC files (services, repositories, utilities); use `TRPCError` only in tRPC routers
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`
- Run `yarn type-check:ci --force` before concluding CI failures are unrelated to your changes
- Import directly from source files, not barrel files (e.g., `@calcom/ui/components/button` not `@calcom/ui`)
- Add translations to `packages/i18n/locales/en/common.json` for all UI strings
- Use `date-fns` or native `Date` instead of Day.js when timezone awareness isn't needed
- Put permission checks in `page.tsx`, never in `layout.tsx`
- Use `ast-grep` for searching if available; otherwise use `rg` (ripgrep), then fall back to `grep`
- Use Biome for formatting and linting
- Only add code comments that explain **why**, not **what** — see [code comment guidelines](agents/rules/quality-code-comments.md)


## Don't

- Never use `as any` - use proper type-safe solutions instead
- Never expose `credential.key` field in API responses or queries
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Never modify `*.generated.ts` files directly - they're created by app-store-cli
- Never put business logic in repositories - that belongs in Services
- Never use barrel imports from index.ts files
- Never skip running type checks before pushing
- Never add comments that simply restate what the code does (e.g., `// Get the user` above a `getUser()` call)

## Commands

See [agents/commands.md](agents/commands.md) for full reference. Key commands:

```bash
yarn workspace @calcom/<pkg> type-check        # Type check the workspace you changed
yarn biome check --write --changed --since=origin/main  # Lint/format only changed files
TZ=UTC yarn test                                # Run unit tests
yarn prisma generate                            # Regenerate types after schema changes
```

Use the full `yarn type-check:ci --force` only when debugging cross-package issues.


## Boundaries

### Always do
- Type-check the affected workspace before committing (not the whole repo)
- Run relevant tests before pushing
- Use `select` in Prisma queries
- Follow conventional commits for PR titles
- Run Biome on changed files before pushing (`yarn biome check --write --changed --since=origin/main`)

### Ask first
- Adding new dependencies
- Schema changes to `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Changes affecting multiple packages
- Deleting files
- Running full build or E2E suites

### Never do
- Commit secrets, API keys, or `.env` files
- Expose `credential.key` in any query
- Use `as any` type casting
- Force push or rebase shared branches
- Modify generated files directly

## Project Structure

```
apps/web/                    # Main Next.js application
packages/prisma/             # Database schema (schema.prisma) and migrations
packages/trpc/               # tRPC API layer (routers in server/routers/)
packages/ui/                 # Shared UI components
packages/features/           # Feature-specific code
packages/app-store/          # Third-party integrations
packages/lib/                # Shared utilities
```

### Key files
- Routes: `apps/web/app/` (App Router)
- Database schema: `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`
- tRPC routers: `packages/trpc/server/routers/`
- Translations: `packages/i18n/locales/en/common.json`
- Workflow constants: `packages/features/ee/workflows/lib/constants.ts`

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 13+ (App Router in some areas)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **API**: tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E)
- **i18n**: next-i18next

## Code Examples

### Good error handling

```typescript
// Good - Descriptive error with context
throw new Error(`Unable to create booking: User ${userId} has no available time slots for ${date}`);

// Bad - Generic error
throw new Error("Booking failed");
```

For which error class to use (`ErrorWithCode` vs `TRPCError`) and concrete examples, see [quality-error-handling](agents/rules/quality-error-handling.md).

### Good Prisma query

```typescript
// Good - Use select for performance and security
const booking = await prisma.booking.findFirst({
  select: {
    id: true,
    title: true,
    user: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
        email: true,
      }
    }
  }
});

// Bad - Include fetches all fields including sensitive ones
const booking = await prisma.booking.findFirst({
  include: { user: true }
});
```

### Good imports

```typescript
// Good - Type imports and direct paths
import type { User } from "@prisma/client";
import { Button } from "@calcom/ui/components/button";

// Bad - Regular import for types, barrel imports
import { User } from "@prisma/client";
import { Button } from "@calcom/ui";
```

### API v2 Imports (apps/api/v2)

When importing from `@calcom/features` or `@calcom/trpc` into `apps/api/v2`, **do not import directly** because the API v2 app's `tsconfig.json` doesn't have path mappings for these modules, which causes "module not found" errors.

Instead, re-export from `packages/platform/libraries/index.ts` and import from `@calcom/platform-libraries`:

```typescript
// Step 1: In packages/platform/libraries/index.ts, add the export
export { ProfileRepository } from "@calcom/features/profile/repositories/ProfileRepository";

// Step 2: In apps/api/v2, import from platform-libraries
import { ProfileRepository } from "@calcom/platform-libraries";

// Bad - Direct import causes module not found error in apps/api/v2
import { ProfileRepository } from "@calcom/features/profile/repositories/ProfileRepository";
```

## PR Checklist

- [ ] Title follows conventional commits: `feat(scope): description`
- [ ] Type check passes on the affected workspace(s)
- [ ] Lint passes on changed files (`yarn biome check --write --changed --since=origin/main`)
- [ ] Relevant tests pass
- [ ] No secrets or API keys committed
- [ ] UI strings added to translation files

## When Stuck

- Ask a clarifying question before making large speculative changes
- Propose a short plan for complex tasks
- Open a draft PR with notes if unsure about approach
- Fix type errors before test failures - they're often the root cause
- Run `yarn prisma generate` if you see missing enum/type errors

## Spec-Driven Development (Opt-In)

For complex features, you can use spec-driven development when explicitly requested.

**To enable:** Tell the AI "use spec-driven development" or "follow the spec workflow"

See [SPEC-WORKFLOW.md](SPEC-WORKFLOW.md) for the full workflow documentation.
