# Cal.com Development Guide for AI Agents

You are a senior Cal.com engineer working in a Yarn/Turbo monorepo. You prioritize type safety, security, and small, reviewable diffs.

## Do

- Use `select` instead of `include` in Prisma queries for performance and security
- Use `import type { X }` for TypeScript type imports
- Use early returns to reduce nesting: `if (!booking) return null;`
- Use `ErrorWithCode` for errors in non-tRPC files (services, repositories, utilities); use `TRPCError` only in tRPC routers
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`
- Create PRs in draft mode by default
- Run `yarn type-check:ci --force` before concluding CI failures are unrelated to your changes
- Import directly from source files, not barrel files (e.g., `@calcom/ui/components/button` not `@calcom/ui`)
- Add translations to `apps/web/public/static/locales/en/common.json` for all UI strings
- Use `date-fns` or native `Date` instead of Day.js when timezone awareness isn't needed
- Put permission checks in `page.tsx`, never in `layout.tsx`
- Use `ast-grep` for searching if available; otherwise use `rg` (ripgrep), then fall back to `grep`
- Use Biome for formatting and linting


## Don't

- Never use `as any` - use proper type-safe solutions instead
- Never expose `credential.key` field in API responses or queries
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Never modify `*.generated.ts` files directly - they're created by app-store-cli
- Never put business logic in repositories - that belongs in Services
- Never use barrel imports from index.ts files
- Never skip running type checks before pushing
- Never create large PRs (>500 lines or >10 files) - split them instead

## PR Size Guidelines

Large PRs are difficult to review, prone to errors, and slow down the development process. Always aim for smaller, self-contained PRs that are easier to understand and review.

### Size Limits

- **Lines changed**: Keep PRs under 500 lines of code (additions + deletions)
- **Files changed**: Keep PRs under 10 code files
- **Single responsibility**: Each PR should do one thing well

**Note**: These limits apply to code files only. Non-code files like documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md), lock files (yarn.lock, package-lock.json), and auto-generated files are excluded from the count.

### How to Split Large Changes

When a task requires extensive changes, break it into multiple PRs:

1. **By layer**: Separate database/schema changes, backend logic, and frontend UI into different PRs
2. **By feature component**: Split a feature into its constituent parts (e.g., API endpoint PR, then UI PR, then integration PR)
3. **By refactor vs feature**: Do preparatory refactoring in a separate PR before adding new functionality
4. **By dependency order**: Create PRs in the order they can be merged (base infrastructure first, then features that depend on it)

### Examples of Good PR Splits

**Instead of one large "Add booking notifications" PR:**
- PR 1: Add notification preferences schema and migration
- PR 2: Add notification service and API endpoints
- PR 3: Add notification UI components
- PR 4: Integrate notifications into booking flow

**Instead of one large "Refactor calendar sync" PR:**
- PR 1: Extract calendar sync logic into dedicated service
- PR 2: Add new calendar provider abstraction
- PR 3: Migrate existing providers to new abstraction
- PR 4: Add new calendar provider support

### Benefits of Smaller PRs

- Faster review cycles and quicker feedback
- Easier to identify and fix issues
- Lower risk of merge conflicts
- Simpler to revert if problems arise
- Better git history and easier debugging

## Commands

### File-scoped (preferred for speed)

```bash
# Type check - always run on changed files
yarn type-check:ci --force

# Lint and format single file
yarn biome check --write path/to/file.tsx

# Unit test specific file
yarn vitest run path/to/file.test.ts

# Unit test specific file + specific test
yarn vitest run path/to/file.test.ts --testNamePattern="specific test name"

# Integration test specific file
VITEST_MODE=integration yarn test path/to/file.integration-test.ts

# Integration test specific file + specific test
VITEST_MODE=integration yarn test path/to/file.integration-test.ts --testNamePattern="specific test name"

# E2E test specific file
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=1 yarn e2e path/to/file.e2e.ts

# E2E test specific file + specific test
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=1 yarn e2e path/to/file.e2e.ts --grep "specific test name"
```

### Project-wide (use sparingly)

```bash
# Development
yarn dev              # Start dev server
yarn dx               # Dev with database setup

# Build & check
yarn build                   # Build all packages
yarn biome check --write .   # Lint and format all
yarn type-check              # Type check all

# Tests (use TZ=UTC for consistency)
TZ=UTC yarn test      # All unit tests
yarn e2e              # All E2E tests

# Database
yarn prisma generate  # Regenerate types after schema changes
yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate  # Run migrations
```

### Biome focused workflow
+
```bash
yarn biome check --write .
yarn type-check:ci --force
```


## Boundaries

### Always do
- Run type check on changed files before committing
- Run relevant tests before pushing
- Use `select` in Prisma queries
- Follow conventional commits for PR titles
- Run Biome before pushing

### Ask first
- Adding new dependencies
- Schema changes to `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Changes affecting multiple packages
- Deleting files
- Running full build or E2E suites

### Never do
- Commit secrets, API keys, or `.env` files
- Expose `credential.key` in any query
- Use `as any` type casting
- Force push or rebase shared branches
- Modify generated files directly

## Code Examples

### Good error handling

```typescript
// Good - Descriptive error with context
throw new Error(`Unable to create booking: User ${userId} has no available time slots for ${date}`);

// Bad - Generic error
throw new Error("Booking failed");
```

For which error class to use (`ErrorWithCode` vs `TRPCError`) and concrete examples, see [Error Types in knowledge-base.md](agents/knowledge-base.md#error-types).

### Good Prisma query

```typescript
// Good - Use select for performance and security
const booking = await prisma.booking.findFirst({
  select: {
    id: true,
    title: true,
    user: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
        email: true,
      }
    }
  }
});

// Bad - Include fetches all fields including sensitive ones
const booking = await prisma.booking.findFirst({
  include: { user: true }
});
```

### Good imports

```typescript
// Good - Type imports and direct paths
import type { User } from "@prisma/client";
import { Button } from "@calcom/ui/components/button";

// Bad - Regular import for types, barrel imports
import { User } from "@prisma/client";
import { Button } from "@calcom/ui";
```

### API v2 Imports (apps/api/v2)

When importing from `@calcom/features` or `@calcom/trpc` into `apps/api/v2`, **do not import directly** because the API v2 app's `tsconfig.json` doesn't have path mappings for these modules, which causes "module not found" errors.

Instead, re-export from `packages/platform/libraries/index.ts` and import from `@calcom/platform-libraries`:

```typescript
// Step 1: In packages/platform/libraries/index.ts, add the export
export { ProfileRepository } from "@calcom/features/profile/repositories/ProfileRepository";

// Step 2: In apps/api/v2, import from platform-libraries
import { ProfileRepository } from "@calcom/platform-libraries";

// Bad - Direct import causes module not found error in apps/api/v2
import { ProfileRepository } from "@calcom/features/profile/repositories/ProfileRepository";
```

## PR Checklist

- [ ] Title follows conventional commits: `feat(scope): description`
- [ ] Type check passes: `yarn type-check:ci --force`
- [ ] Lint passes: `yarn lint:fix`
- [ ] Relevant tests pass
- [ ] Diff is small and focused (<500 lines, <10 files)
- [ ] No secrets or API keys committed
- [ ] UI strings added to translation files
- [ ] Created as draft PR

## When Stuck

- Ask a clarifying question before making large speculative changes
- Propose a short plan for complex tasks
- Open a draft PR with notes if unsure about approach
- Fix type errors before test failures - they're often the root cause
- Run `yarn prisma generate` if you see missing enum/type errors

## Business rules
1. Managed event types
- When a managed event type is created we create a managed event type for team (parent managed event type) and for each user that has been assigned to it (child managed event type). Parent managed event type will have "teamId" set in the EventType table row and child one "userId". If we create managed event type and assign Alice and Bob then three rows will be inserted in the EventType table.
- It is possible to book only child managed event type.

2. Organizations and teams both are stored in the "Team" table. Organizations have "isOrganization" set to true, and if the entry has
"parentId" set then it means it is a team within an organization.

3. There are two types of OAuth clients you have to distinguish between:
- "OAuth client" which resides in the "OAuthClient" table. This OAuth client allows 3rd party apps users to connect their cal.com accounts.
- "Platform OAuth client" which resides in the "PlatformOAuthClient" table. This OAuth client is used only by platform customers integrating cal.com scheduling directly in their platforms.
If someone says "platform OAuth client" then they mean the one in the "PlatformOAuthClient" table.
