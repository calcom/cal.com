2. __Explain the custom endpoint resolution logic for nested tRPC routers.__ (Complex path splitting logic)
3. __How do you handle SuperJSON transformation in a tRPC monorepo setup?__
4. __Design a mutation with optimistic updates for a scheduling system.__

### Multiple State Managers

1. __When would you choose Jotai vs Recoil for different state management needs?__ (Both are used in the codebase)
2. __How do you handle authentication state distribution across a NextAuth + tRPC setup?__

## __Form Handling & Validation__

### React Hook Form + Zod

1. __How would you implement complex nested form validation for event scheduling with time zone handling?__
2. __Explain error composition patterns when using @hookform/error-message with Zod schemas.__
3. __How do you handle form state persistence in a multi-step booking flow?__

## __UI/UX & Accessibility__

### Radix UI Integration

1. __How do you implement custom animations with Radix primitives?__ (@formkit/auto-animate usage)
2. __Explain dialog portal handling for embed environments.__
3. __How would you build a complex date/time picker with multi-threshold selection?__

### Theme & Internationalization

1. __How do you handle runtime theme switching with Tailwind CSS?__ (Found in layout.tsx)
2. __What's the pattern for handling bidirectional text in a scheduling interface?__
3. __How do you implement lazy loading for internationalized routes?__

## __Performance Optimization Questions__

### Advanced Next.js Optimizations

1. __How would you implement intersection observer for calendar grid virtualization?__
2. __Explain the bundle analysis setup and budget management__ (nextBundleAnalysis in package.json)
3. __How do you prevent layout shift in embedded booking widgets?__

### API Optimization

1. __Design efficient data fetching strategies for calendar availability checking with caching.__
2. __How would you implement request deduplication with TanStack Query for multiple calendar sources?__
3. __Explain optimistic UI updates for appointment booking with rollback strategies.__

## __Testing & Quality Assurance__

### Modern Testing Stack

1. __How do you set up Vitest for a component library with mock configurations?__ (setupVitest.ts pattern)
2. __Explain integration testing for tRPC endpoints with MSW mocking.__
3. __How would you test lifecycle hooks in embedded booking experiences?__

## __Architecture & Design Patterns__

### Monorepo Patterns

1. __How do you manage cross-package dependencies in a turbo-powered monorepo?__ (Turbo.json setup)
2. __Explain the UI component export strategy with conditional bundling.__
3. __How do you handle version inconsistencies across workspace packages?__

### Embed & Integration

1. __Design a secure iframe communication system for booking embeds.__ (See layout.tsx embed handling)
2. __How would you implement theme synchronization between host and embedded application?__
3. __Explain the cross-origin request handling for embedded booking forms.__

## __Real-world Problem Solving__

### Business Logic Implementation

1. __How would you implement timezone-aware scheduling with conflict detection?__
2. __Design a real-time calendar availability system with optimistic locking.__
3. __How do you handle recurring event modifications without side effects?__

### Security & Performance

1. __Explain CSP implementation challenges in a dynamic booking application.__ (CSP nonce handling)
2. __How do you protect against XSS in user-generated calendar descriptions?__
3. __Design rate limiting for booking endpoints in a Next.js API route.__

These questions cover the sophisticated patterns used in Cal.com including advanced React patterns, tRPC architecture, multiple state management solutions, and real-world booking system challenges.

cerate adocument withabove study notes

API Request$0.0000

Thinking:The user wants me to create a document with the study notes from my previous analysis. I should create a comprehensive document that includes all the interview questions I generated, organized into sections with explanations and code examples where relevant. This would be a valuable study guide for frontend interview preparation based on the Cal.com codebase. ‎

Cline wants to create a new file:

/frontend-interview-questions-calcom.md‎

API Request$0.0000

Thinking:The linter has flagged some spelling issues: ## Reviewing Linter Feedback - The linter flagged "Jotai" and "Vitest" as spelling issues. - Found that "Jotai" is correct; it's a proper name for a Japanese atomic state management library. - Also confirmed "Vitest" is accurate, aligning with standard naming conventions.‎

Thinking:I see the previous replace_in_file operation failed. The file content shows it's empty now, but I can see from the previous response that the file was successfully created and contains the content. The linter warnings are actually for correct technical terms: ## Investigating file operation - The replace_in_file operation appears to have failed, leaving the file empty. - Previously, the file was successfully created and contained the expected content, indicating a potential issue with the operation.‎
