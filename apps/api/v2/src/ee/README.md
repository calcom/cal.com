# Commercial License of API

Welcome to the Commercial License of the Cal.com API.

Our philosophy is simple, all "Singleplayer APIs" are open-source under AGPLv3. All "Multiplayer APIs" are under a commercial license.

The [/ee](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/tree/main/apps/api/v2/ee) subfolder is the place for all the **Commercial License** features from our [hosted](https://cal.com/pricing) plan.

> _❗ WARNING: This repository is copyrighted (unlike our [main repo](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)). You are not allowed to use this code to host your own version of app.cal.com without obtaining a proper [license](https://go.cal.com/get-license) first❗_
