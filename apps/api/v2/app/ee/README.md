# Enterprise Edition of API

Welcome to the Enterprise Edition ("/ee") of the Cal.com API.

Our philosophy is simple, all "Singleplayer APIs" are open-source under AGPLv3. All "Multiplayer APIs" are under a commercial license.

The [/ee](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/tree/main/apps/api/v2/ee) subfolder is the place for all the **Enterprise Edition** features from our [hosted](https://cal.com/pricing) plan and enterprise-grade features for [Enterprise](https://cal.com/enterprise) such as SSO, SAML, OIDC, SCIM, SIEM and much more or [Platform](https://cal.com/platform) plan to build a marketplace.
