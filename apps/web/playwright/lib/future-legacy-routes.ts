 * Small wrapper around test.describe().
 * When using testbothFutureLegacyRoutes.describe() instead of test.describe(), this will run the specified
 * tests twice. One with the pages route, and one with the new app dir "future" route. It will also add the route variant
 * name to the test name for easier debugging.
 * Finally it also adds a parameter routeVariant to your testBothFutureAndLegacyRoutes.describe() callback, which
 * can be used to do any conditional rendering in the test for a specific route variant (should be as little
 * as possible).
 *
 * See apps/web/playwright/event-types.e2e.ts for an example.
