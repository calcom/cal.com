Dive into the specifics of each API endpoint by checking out our complete documentation. Unlike many other platforms, our API gives you access to every single data model within the application, meaning that you can replicate the entire functionality of Cal.com in your own app using the API.

Hence, this page shows you which API routes are most useful in order to prevent you from being overwhelmed with every single route available to you.

## The basics

You'll need only a few of the routes to be able to cover the basic functionality.
