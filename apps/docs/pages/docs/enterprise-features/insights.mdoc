**Insights** is a comprehensive analytics tool designed to help team leads and members gain deep understanding and visibility into how their events are managed and engaged with over time. By aggregating data across several dimensions, Insights aims to provide actionable intelligence to optimize team performance and event management strategies.

This feature focuses on several key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide a detailed overview of team activities within the application. The data is presented in a user-friendly dashboard, allowing users to quickly understand their event dynamics.
