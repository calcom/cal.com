# Vercel

## Requirements

You need a PostgresDB database hosted somewhere. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) offers a great free option.

## Getting Started

### Local settings

1. Fork and clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/cal.com.git
   ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file in `apps/web`, rename it to `.env` and fill it with your settings ([See manual setup](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com#manual-setup) and [Obtaining the Google API Credentials](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com#obtaining-the-google-api-credentials))

3. Install packages with `yarn`

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Set up the database using the Prisma schema (found in `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`)

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

5. Open [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio) to look at or modify the database content:
   ```
   yarn db-studio
   ```
6. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
7. Fill out the fields (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.
8. Open a browser to [port 3000](http://localhost:3000) on your localhost and login with your just created, first user.

1. Import from your forked repository
