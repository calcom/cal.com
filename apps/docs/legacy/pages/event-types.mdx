# Event Types
Event types allow you to create different events for different occasions when booking a time with you in your calendar. These can be named differently, have different time durations and the choice of platform can change.

## Creating an event type
1. Go to [Your Event Types](https://app.cal.com/event-types).
2. Click the button at the top right of your screen saying '+ New Event Type'.
3. Create the title of your new event.
4. Confirm the auto-generated event type URL.
5. Create a description on what your event will be used for.
6. Decide on the amount of minutes you wish for this event to last for.
7. Press 'Continue'
8. Your event has now been created!

## Editing event types
1. Go to [Your Event Types](https://app.cal.com/event-types).
2. Click anywhere within the box of the event you would like to edit.  
   (From here you can edit the basic settings of your event)
3. To get the advanced options, at the bottom of your event setting click 'Show Advanced Settings'
4. After you have finished editing the event type, scroll to the bottom of your page and select 'Update'
5. Your event type has now been updated.

## Deleting event types
1. Go to [Your Event Types](https://app.cal.com/event-types).
2. Click anywhere within the box of the event, just like you would if you were editing the event.
3. From this page, just to the right, a button saying 'delete' will appear. Click this and your event will be deleted!

## How to block a time slot before/after a meeting
You can block out a time frame in your calendar only after the meeting. You can do this by selecting `Show advanced settings` of your Event Type. The setting is labeled `Time-slot intervals`.

## Setting up specific availability for each type of Event 
Head to `Show advanced settings` of your event. At the bottom you can set up specific availability for different Event Types.

## Setting up a name for your Event Type that shows in the calendar
1. Go to your Event Type
2. Click on `Show advanced settings`.
3. Under `Event Name`, enter your desired name that you want displayed in Cal and your integrated calendars. If you want the name of the booker to be pulled in the name of the event, just follow this form: `any-text-here {USER}`. Make sure that the USER is in all capital letters. So, for example, if you confirmed a meeting with John Doe and in the Event Name of that Event Type you wrote `Meeting with {USER}`, the event name in all calendars will be `Meeting with John Doe`

## Availability not showing on a certain day in your calendar
Head over to your event and once you click on `Show advanced settings`, make sure your time zones are correct. Also, check if you have any calendar events scheduled that could overlap with your availability.

## People can't book me even though there is still a couple of hours left on my availability for today
Head over to your event and once you click on `Show advanced settings`, have a look at the `Minimum booking notice`. It probably overlaps with your availability so make sure that notice fits your desired time frame for meetings. For example, if someone wants to book a meeting with you at 16:15 and it’s already 15:30, your 90 minutes minimum booking notice doesn’t allow that meeting to be booked.
