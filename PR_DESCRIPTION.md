# Fix Critical S1 Booking Double-Booking Issue with Atomic Reservation System

## What does this PR do?

This PR fixes a critical S1 issue where the booking system allowed creating bookings on reserved slots without proper validation, leading to possible double-bookings. This was escalated by Udemy and affects enterprise clients.

**Key Changes:**
- Implements atomic reservation validation and consumption during booking creation
- Adds `reservedSlotUid` field to booking schema and flow
- Ensures race condition prevention through database transactions
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing booking flows
- Adds comprehensive error handling for expired, invalid, and mismatched reservations

- Fixes #XXXX (GitHub issue number)
- Fixes CAL-XXXX (Linear issue number - should be visible at the bottom of the GitHub issue description)

## Technical Implementation

### Problem
Users could create bookings on reserved time slots without proper validation, causing race conditions where multiple users could book the same slot simultaneously.

### Solution
Implemented an atomic transaction-based approach that:

1. **Validates reservation existence** - Checks if the reserved slot UID exists
2. **Verifies expiration** - Ensures the reservation hasn't expired
3. **Matches time slots** - Validates that reservation time matches booking time
4. **Atomically consumes reservation** - Deletes the reservation within the same transaction as booking creation

### Files Modified
- `packages/features/bookings/lib/bookingCreateBodySchema.ts` - Added reservedSlotUid schema validation
- `packages/features/bookings/lib/handleNewBooking.ts` - Updated booking flow to extract and pass reservedSlotUid
- `packages/features/bookings/lib/handleNewBooking/createBooking.ts` - Implemented atomic transaction logic
- `packages/features/bookings/lib/book-event-form/booking-to-mutation-input-mapper.tsx` - Updated type definitions and mapping
- `packages/platform/atoms/hooks/bookings/useHandleBookEvent.ts` - Integrated reservation ID hook
- `packages/features/bookings/lib/handleNewBooking/test/reservation-handling.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

## Visual Demo (For contributors especially)

#### Code Flow Demonstration:

**Before (Race Condition):**
```
User A: Reserve Slot → Create Booking ✅
User B: Reserve Slot → Create Booking ✅ (DOUBLE BOOKING!)
```

**After (Atomic Fix):**
```
User A: Reserve Slot → Atomic: Validate + Consume + Create Booking ✅
User B: Reserve Slot → Atomic: Validation Fails (slot consumed) ❌
```

#### Key Code Changes:

**New Atomic Transaction Logic:**
```typescript
return prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  if (reservedSlotUid) {
    const reservation = await tx.selectedSlots.findUnique({
      where: { uid: reservedSlotUid },
    });
    
    if (!reservation) {
      throw new Error("Reserved slot not found or already consumed");
    }
    
    // Validate expiration and time matching
    // ...validation logic...
    
    // Atomically delete reservation
    await tx.selectedSlots.delete({
      where: { uid: reservedSlotUid },
    });
  }
  
  // Create booking within same transaction
  const booking = await tx.booking.create(createBookingObj);
  return booking;
});
```

## Mandatory Tasks (DO NOT REMOVE)

- [x] I have self-reviewed the code (A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected).
- [x] I have updated the developer docs in /docs if this PR makes changes that would require a [documentation change](https://cal.com/docs). Added comprehensive documentation in `RESERVATION_SYSTEM_FIX.md`.
- [x] I confirm automated tests are in place that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.

## How should this be tested?

### Test Environment Setup
- No special environment variables required
- Standard Cal.com development setup with database access

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. **Happy Path - Valid Reservation**
```javascript
// Create a valid reservation
const reservation = await createSlotReservation(eventTypeId, startTime, endTime);

// Book with reservation UID
const booking = await createBooking({
  eventTypeId,
  start: startTime,
  end: endTime,
  reservedSlotUid: reservation.uid,
  // ...other booking data
});

// Expected: Booking created successfully, reservation consumed
```

#### 2. **Error Cases**
```javascript
// Test expired reservation
const expiredReservation = await createExpiredReservation();
await expect(createBooking({ reservedSlotUid: expiredReservation.uid }))
  .rejects.toThrow("Reserved slot has expired");

// Test non-existent reservation
await expect(createBooking({ reservedSlotUid: "invalid-uid" }))
  .rejects.toThrow("Reserved slot not found or already consumed");

// Test time mismatch
const reservation = await createReservation(startTime1);
await expect(createBooking({ 
  reservedSlotUid: reservation.uid,
  start: startTime2 // Different time
})).rejects.toThrow("Reserved slot time does not match booking time");
```

#### 3. **Backward Compatibility**
```javascript
// Booking without reservation should work normally
const booking = await createBooking({
  eventTypeId,
  start: startTime,
  end: endTime,
  // No reservedSlotUid - should work as before
});
// Expected: Normal booking creation
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run the new reservation tests
yarn test packages/features/bookings/lib/handleNewBooking/test/reservation-handling.test.ts

# Run integration tests
yarn test <filename> -- --integrationTestsOnly

# Run full booking flow tests
yarn test packages/features/bookings/lib/handleNewBooking/test/
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to booking page for any event type
2. Select a time slot (this creates a reservation in the background)
3. Fill out booking form and submit
4. Verify booking is created and reservation is consumed
5. Try to book the same slot again - should fail appropriately

## Checklist

<!-- Remove bullet points below that don't apply to you -->

- ~~I haven't read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)~~
- ~~My code doesn't follow the style guidelines of this project~~
- ~~I haven't commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas~~
- ~~I haven't checked if my changes generate no new warnings~~

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Only one additional database query for reservation validation when `reservedSlotUid` is provided
- **No impact on existing flows**: Backward compatible - no changes for bookings without reservations
- **Improved reliability**: Prevents data inconsistency and double-bookings

## Security Considerations

- **Input validation**: `reservedSlotUid` is validated through Zod schema
- **Authorization**: Reservation validation ensures only valid, non-expired reservations can be consumed
- **Atomic operations**: Database transactions prevent partial state corruption

## Documentation

Complete technical documentation available in:
- `RESERVATION_SYSTEM_FIX.md` - Technical implementation details
- Inline code comments explaining atomic transaction logic
- Comprehensive test documentation with examples
